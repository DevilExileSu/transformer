do	you	think	we	look	young	enough	to	blend	in	at	a	high	school	?
hi	,	honey	.	i	guess	you	're	really	tied	up	in	meetings	.
because	you	want	to	start	a	family	before	you	hit	the	nursing	home	.
she	's	got	to	have	me	in	her	sight	like	24	hours	a	day	.
find	a	safety	chain	or	something	to	keep	these	lights	in	place	.
so	that	no	parent	has	to	go	through	what	i	've	known	.
i	have	to	go	to	the	date	,	learn	to	dance	.	definitely	.	now	.
is	when	someone	we	've	trusted	makes	the	choice	for	us	.
okay	.	well	,	i	guess	there	's	not	much	to	do	about	it	right	now	then	.
i	respect	that	,	and	i	will	protect	it	at	all	cost	.
yeah	,	it	's	getting	weird	.	-	let	's	get	out	of	here	.
so	after	investigators	got	a	blood	trace	on	the	doorknob	,
which	means	if	we	do	n't	find	her	,	she	's	only	got	two	weeks	to	live	.
but	,	still	,	i	'm	starting	to	think	it	would	be	smart
if	you	want	to	remain	team	manager	,	you	have	to	do	this	.
okay	?	you	wing	your	ass	down	here	and	you	tell	him	i	do	n't	know	.
because	you	need	to	know	that	whoever	you	're	protecting	is	damn	sure	gon	na	be	selfish
and	you	can	also	see	the	theater	staircase	very	well	preserved	;
you	gon	na	take	care	of	his	kids	,	huh	,	after	he	's	gone	?
cos	that	's	not	what	i	'm	hearing	.	still	,	what	do	i	know	?
i	am	not	going	back	for	more	and	i	ca	n't	even	believe
where	is	he	?	get	on	.	get	on	the	fucking	ground	!
you	knew	it	in	your	heart	you	have	n't	washed	your	hair
do	you	now	amend	that	to	god	and	correctional	officers	?
and	i	already	have	a	place	,	okay	?	it	's	at	your	place	.
i	was	the	same	way	after	i	lost	the	baby	.
yeah	,	i	will	tell	you	.	this	is	our	crime	scene	.	we	are	taking	it	.
his	legitimate	business	brings	in	what	?	five	million	a	year	to	us	?
bring	it	home	,	kid	!	the	finish	line	is	wide	open	!
you	know	i	'm	paying	for	these	tickets	.	it	's	all	right	.	i	got	lunch	.
just	get	over	there	and	talk	some	sense	into	her	.
her	face	will	be	the	last	thing	you	see	before	you	black	out	from	the	chloroform	.
the	two	with	the	lowest	number	of	votes	will	be	leaving	us
so	i	let	her	believe	that	she	was	getting	to	me	.
i	began	to	open	speeches	with	a	line	and	it	became	kind	of	a	signature	.
and	that	every	young	man	who	chooses	to	remain	at	home
may	i	have	a	word	,	please	?	what	do	you	want	?
i	left	my	bag	of	chargers	at	home	.	did	i	?
he	found	it	the	night	the	president	went	to	the	national	archives	to	view	the	constitution	,
he	should	be	first	.	i	'll	make	it	up	to	you	.
the	third	game	of	the	world	series	was	about	to	begin
i	took	the	best	offer	while	i	had	a	chance	.
that	was	an	awful	lot	of	trouble	just	to	impress	your	fans	.
getting	filled	out	like	an	application	constitutes	being	with	a	guy	.
you	guys	need	to	stop	being	such	asses	and	start	being	bad	-	asses	.
if	this	is	some	fucking	ruse	to	get	me	to	talk	about	...
the	only	insulting	he	ever	did	was	stick	that	thing	of	his	...
at	the	turn	of	the	tide	,	water	from	almost	seven	hundred	miles	.
the	skitters	were	there	at	the	pickets	'	farm	when	i	went	back	.
just	give	her	a	chance	to	cool	off	,	man	,	and	then	you	'll	talk	,	okay	?
noise	-	induced	vertigo	means	ear	or	brain	.	head	ct	was	clean	,	so	i	'm	thinking	acoustic	neuroma	.
and	you	can	see	-	it	looks	almost	like	an	underground	subway	or	something	like	that	.
i	can	give	you	time	to	discuss	it	,	but	this	is	a	decision	that	needs	to	be	made	soon	.
it	made	me	feel	very	pleased	and	excited	that	something	was	happening	,
can	we	see	a	copy	of	that	fax	?	they	would	n't	give	it	to	me	.
i	never	dreamed	that	one	of	my	own	would	be	going	off	to	a	university	,	but	here	i	stand	,
i	'm	so	tired	of	saying	no	and	then	waking	up	in	the	morning	...
it	's	too	bad	the	cnn	factor	did	n't	kick	in	a	little	sooner	.
i	told	her	she	might	have	to	get	her	own	place	,
the	not	so	little	voice	in	pinky	mccoy	's	head	agreed	.
rated	1	out	of	22	hotels	in	lewisville	on	trip	adviser	.
i	'm	hoping	that	he	likes	it	and	i	'm	able	to	impress	him	.
i	was	so	afraid	...	i	was	so	cold	and	loosing	my	mind	...
get	the	fuck	off	me	.	-	hey	,	take	it	easy	.
the	point	is	gentlemen	,	our	world	is	coming	to	an	end
i	appreciate	all	of	this	,	especially	knowing	how	busy	you	are	running	around	looking	for	that	hothead	,
next	time	,	make	sure	your	client	really	committed	a	crime	.
i	've	never	seen	two	people	so	on	the	same	page	.
that	's	exactly	what	happened	to	me	last	night	.	he	disappeared	.
who	are	they	buying	arms	from	?	what	are	they	gon	na	do	with	them	?
i	want	your	full	attention	on	the	streetcar	death	,	all	right	?
well	,	kenneth	woke	up	this	morning	and	jessica	was	n't	there	,
i	'm	told	we	can	draw	back	the	duties	paid	at	the	customs	.
oh	,	all	right	.	well	,	i	'll	be	,	i	'll	be	this	guy	.
what	did	the	major	have	to	say	?	he	said	the	last	message
and	she	utilized	said	law	firm	to	set	up	a	trust	,
i	thought	you	meant	the	things	that	you	said	on	that	tape	,
another	way	to	meet	damaged	women	is	to	hang	out	with	actresses	.
what	are	you	going	to	do	?	-	hold	my	dress	!
hey	,	are	you	gon	na	try	and	get	back	in	the	game	?
she	makes	me	feel	like	i	have	a	life	again	.
so	i	shall	do	none	of	these	until	she	can	.
we	have	had	banquets	in	the	headquarters	in	these	nights
are	you	guys	-	are	you	guys	really	secret	service	?
have	you	been	in	my	bag	?	i	thought	i	heard	your	phone	ring	.
besides	,	we	do	n't	need	a	lawyer	because	i	'm	a	lawyer	.
i	am	not	jealous	and	i	have	never	said	i	did	not	like	her	.
what	brought	you	out	to	this	lott	rock	?	uncle	sam	.
but	when	they	are	in	the	sand	it	's	a	whole	different	story	.
if	you	are	lying	to	me	,	i	will	end	you	.
and	like	every	time	,	snot	,	he	'd	fade	a	few	shooters	.
i	knew	that	i	was	gon	na	be	doing	"	lost	"	for	quite	a	while	.	-	is	it	working	?
i	...	i	do	n't	remember	why	we	had	a	falling	-	out	.
she	's	a	right	phantom	,	she	is	.	the	way	she	come	up	again	,	right	behind	us	like	that	.
so	i	would	n't	get	their	hopes	up	about	her	blood	matching	his	.
between	now	and	my	birthday	,	i	do	n't	want	to	think	about	the	claiming	.
i	'll	go	get	my	things	.	can	we	stop	and	do	an	errand	on	the	way	?
you	do	n't	remember	where	i	left	the	car	,	do	you	?
okay	,	from	now	on	,	i	'll	stay	out	of	your	life	.
filled	only	with	salt	water	then	i	can	create	a	circuit	.
ah	,	maybe	there	's	no	need	to	go	into	the	third	and	fourth	courses	.
it	's	just	that	if	he	's	not	going	to	ask	his	cabinet	for	help	,
why	not	?	-	it	's	illegal	.	they	would	take	it	to	the	police	.
right	,	to	marry	a	person	after	only	a	two	day	acquaintance
i	always	thought	you	were	the	hottest	piece	of	ass	on	this	boat	.
sounds	odd	for	a	place	that	keeps	such	meticulous	records	.
you	still	do	n't	even	know	what	you	done	,	do	you	?
to	something	she	was	slipped	at	a	party	.	she	did	n't	know	she	was	taking	it	.
i	might	as	well	have	it	out	with	the	president	.
hey	,	what	are	you	guys	going	to	do	with	this	money	anyway	?
it	certainly	makes	me	wonder	about	your	ideas	of	friendship	.
i	wo	n't	freak	out	on	you	like	your	dad	would	.
it	's	a	little	top	-	heavy	,	but	it	should	n't	affect	turns	less	than	60	degrees	.
yeah	,	well	,	you	know	i	did	n't	have	any	plans	last	night	,	so	i	went	to	bed	at	8:00	.
hey	,	baby	.	what	's	up	?	i	thought	you	were	spending	the	night	out	.
and	then	the	little	bastards	turn	out	to	have	souls	all	their	own	,
i	gave	my	body	to	you	.	i	broke	my	marriage	vows	.
are	going	to	be	the	same	as	they	were	under	cournot	,
hey	,	mom	,	you	know	,	i	need	to	go	.	i	'm	sorry	.	bye	.
zeke	.	do	n't	play	with	me	.	i	've	got	too	much	going	on	here	.
i	do	n't	want	to	seem	unfriendly	,	but	this	is	not	a	psychic	platform	.
there	was	...	there	was	an	article	by	a	cambridge	professor	.
even	though	sinclair	by	a	miracle	where	she	is	looking	for	,
is	a	good	example	of	how	an	issue	can	be	framed	very	narrowly	.
merciful	is	the	lord	.	cooperate	,	and	no	one	gets	hurt	.
we	just	do	n't	have	time	to	waste	on	the	wrong	man	.
only	ugly	and	fat	girls	go	there	.	at	my	school	,	maigai	high	school	.
if	he	wants	to	be	center	fielder	for	the	mets	,
she	's	the	new	element	that	's	been	introduced	to	his	environment	,
a	lawyer	's	not	gon	na	help	you	,	son	.	just	bring	me	a	lawyer	.
how	could	you	just	let	them	leave	?	hey	,	hey	.
and	i	'm	sad	that	i	have	to	send	somebody	home	tonight	.
please	know	it	was	never	like	it	was	with	you	.
i	switched	places	with	her	,	so	we	could	get	to	the	safe	in	the	sheikh	's	suite	.
i	just	did	n't	know	how	to	phrase	it	until	now	.
i	can	collect	$	150k	if	i	turn	you	in
i	'll	give	you	your	money	back	!	-	i	did	n't	know	that	.
i	beg	your	pardon	?	-	i	know	when	a	man	is	gone	.
we	got	to	get	you	downstairs	.	-	what	's	going	on	?
oh	,	wow	.	you	guys	are	in	for	a	real	treat	.
do	you	realize	what	girls	go	through	to	make	themselves	beautiful	?	.
just	do	n't	let	the	paparazzi	take	photos	of	you	in	that	dress	.
well	,	it	might	be	better	then	.	but	what	sort	of	people	,	wiggy	?
if	neither	of	you	are	married	by	40	,	you	will	marry	joey	?
and	i	have	a	sneaking	suspicion	that	this	beautiful	woman	next	to	me	.
because	i	just	built	this	thing	over	here	and	i	want	to	get	a	second	opinion	.
but	i	figured	once	i	heard	the	details	of	the	trip	i	would	feel	better	.
i	know	i	told	you	a	lot	of	pretty	things	about	your	father	-
like	such	an	empty	feeling	.	you	know	what	i	mean	?
so	he	takes	a	kid	off	the	trail	in	the	fall
when	she	did	n't	come	around	,	i	assumed	she	was	dead	.
about	the	murder	of	matsuda	shinkichi	51	who	was	found	dead	in	his	office	,
until	today	i	was	n't	even	sure	that	she	was	killed	.
you	did	n't	happen	to	mention	how	nice	it	would	be
and	i	'm	not	paranoid	.	and	i	'm	not	questioning	my	own	sanity	.
i	know	.	they	were	at	the	lab	a	half	-	hour	ago	.
i	could	jump	off	the	balcony	right	here	into	the	pool	?
oh	,	right	...	i	'm	sorry	.	i	did	n't	mean	to	try	to	change	...
but	i	lost	him	while	we	were	exploring	the	area	where	we	crash	landed	.
if	you	quit	viewing	books	as	a	last	word	on	something	,	you	'd	spout	less	bullshit	.
hey	,	i	've	finally	come	up	with	the	main	theme	for	the	christmas	play	.
you	know	what	would	make	surgery	quicker	?	if	we	did	n't	have	to	be	clean	.
why	are	you	here	,	in	god	's	name	?	-	none	of	your	business	,	traitor	!
oh	,	my	god	!	look	at	this	place	!	hey	,	look	at	me	on	the	big	screen	.
in	the	past	few	months	,	46	other	children	who	went	missing	that	same	year	turn	up	.
you	pretend	like	you	've	been	having	problems	with	your	voice	mail
the	trial	was	used	to	overload	the	internet	to	divert	us	from	what	they	were	really	doing	.
no	.	it	's	more	than	just	a	ghost	story	.	and	the	adults	believed	in	it	,	as	well	.
if	you	want	me	to	report	about	you	,	tell	me	where	you	are	from	.
she	said	not	to	make	a	big	deal	out	of	it	.
it	's	dumbo	,	the	flying	idiot	.	i	left	him	treating	a	burn	.
i	asked	you	to	do	one	thing	for	me	last	night	,	dad	.
no	worries	,	man	.	i	will	make	you	a	rock	star	.
i	freak	out	when	he	asks	what	kind	of	cereal	i	want	.
merrily	,	merrily	,	merrily	,	merrily	life	is	but	a	dream	row	,	row	,	row	your	boat
i	know	he	does	n't	want	to	talk	to	me	and	i	...
i	also	do	n't	know	why	it	irradiated	and	set	off	my	alarm	.
i	mean	,	when	the	previous	contestant	was	asking	what	they	should	sing	,
then	exit	at	24	melle	ost	and	then	follow	the	instructions	to	the	best	western	amedia	bielefeld	/	werther	.
after	everything	that	we	went	through	to	get	...	to	help	him	.
because	they	are	stupid	.	where	were	you	last	night	?
i	only	found	out	about	this	piece	when	it	came	out	.
with	or	without	your	help	,	okay	?	now	could	i	see	the	body	?	that	is	so	going	in	the	movie	.
i	did	it	all	for	you	,	and	all	for	nothing
and	that	's	exactly	what	i	wanted	to	do	-	get	in	.
if	i	can	not	establish	this	affair	-	and	right	now	i	ca	n't	-	he	may	very	well	be	convicted	.
besides	,	relax	.	we	're	not	on	a	shift	.	we	're	on	vacation	.
we	read	in	"	the	new	york	times	"	today	a	story	that	says
how	can	i	help	you	do	yours	?	answer	some	questions	.
all	right	,	easy	.	thank	you	,	ladies	,	for	coming	down	.
but	i	bet	he	went	back	to	his	own	time	.
get	him	loaned	to	our	division	to	help	us	in	the	legwork	.
that	today	would	be	the	day	your	past	catches	up	to	you	?
is	the	original	stone	that	all	these	ancient	structures	were	built	in	.
if	you	could	show	that	story	is	rubbish	,	then	the	whole	of	descartes	'	philosophy	falls	to	bits	and	bang	,
he	wanted	to	make	it	look	like	our	first	sergeant
to	understand	why	,	you	have	to	see	them	not	as	individual	seas	,
if	you	just	take	good	care	of	him	,	he	'll	take	really	good	care	of	you	,	okay	?
i	was	the	first	one	to	get	a	job	,	working	nights	at	the	hospital	.
our	hotel	has	various	meeting	spaces	for	many	different	functions	and	can	accommodate	up	to	120	guests	.
um	,	let	me	introduce	myself	.	my	-	my	name	is	beck	.
i	know	you	do	n't	trust	me	,	jonathan	.	you	have	no	reason	to	,
interest	rate	market	to	get	1	dollar	if	the	interest	rate	goes
oh	,	you	got	rid	of	the	couch	.	-	yeah	,	the	couch	was	a	problem	.
i	love	him	and	i	want	to	spend	the	rest	of	my	life	with	him	.
you	need	to	look	at	me	.	i	still	love	him	.
if	you	look	at	my	paper	,	sweetie	,	you	will	see	that	we	have	to	sing	from	our	lyginical	quartilages	.
i	broke	in	from	the	window	to	save	her	life
but	the	largest	and	most	powerful	magnetic	fields	in	the	universe
i	ca	n't	believe	he	's	going	to	be	on	law	order	!
i	feel	like	there	's	a	bit	of	an	act	going	on	all	the	time	.
yeah	,	well	,	what	you	call	your	best	i	call	being	difficult	.
first	time	in	months	,	and	i	'm	so	looking	forward	to	this	.
i	'm	going	to	take	her	over	there	.	yeah	big	time	!
standard	room	offers	a	two	standard	size	beds	and	working	area	with	a	desk	.
well	,	then	...	why	did	n't	you	say	so	?	it	's	in	her	eyes	.
hey	,	what	are	you	doing	to	me	?	they	hit	into	another	one	.
what	are	the	odds	that	-	what	's	this	thing	called	?
that	's	all	i	need	to	hear	.	every	cop	on	the	force	knows	about	the	roark	family	's	farm
but	then	,	i	do	not	understand	this	.	your	father	's	name	is	chapman	.
if	i	was	good	at	something	it	's	probably	just	a	waste	of	time	,
i	have	a	vantage	-	point	on	a	huge	international	incident	no	other	reporter	has	.
this	non	-	smoking	room	has	plenty	of	sleeping	space	with	two	comfortable	queen	beds	.
4.2	star	wood	fire	protection	and	fire	life	safety	design	requirements	:
what	do	you	want	me	to	do	?	take	everything	and	go	abroad	?
this	is	supposed	to	be	his	table	,	but	i	do	n't	see	him	anywhere	.
i	've	come	a	long	way	from	being	the	boy	who	was	bit	by	a	spider	.
you	know	,	he	spent	over	a	year	with	the	maasai	.
now	if	i	want	to	know	where	i	came	from	,
were	you	aware	that	she	was	twice	treated	for	alcohol	addiction	?
is	n't	there	someway	i	could	cultivate	some	crazy	outlaw	image	?
plus	you	're	fucking	up	a	five	billion	dollar	a	week	operation	.
you	know	we	have	some	product	that	needs	to	move	.
the	spacious	lakeside	villa	bathroom	with	an	open	-	air	shower	option
i	may	have	mentioned	deportation	,	but	i	did	n't	think	she	'd	take	it	personally	.
if	these	blackouts	are	someone	trying	to	get	to	us	,
she	was	always	running	out	of	towels	,	and	pins	in	the	bed	!
a	microwave	and	refrigerator	are	also	included	for	your	convenience	.
and	if	you	have	them	,	they	bring	for	.	before	another	man	.
hey	.	-	what	's	going	on	?	i	've	been	trying	to	call	you	.
hysterically	funny	,	but	not	funny	looking	guy	comes	up	and	says	it	...
if	you	can	sabotage	machines	,	you	would	n't	sabotage	one	you	're	in	.
he	was	recommended	to	me	by	one	of	our	men	.
this	rich	guy	who	flies	to	d.	c.	every	week	.
i	'm	the	head	of	the	noblest	branch	of	the	family
this	is	her	wedding	day	.	that	's	way	more	important	than	some	stupid	kids	.
there	's	been	nobody	down	that	chamber	before	kate	and	i.
even	if	you	sell	all	your	stock	and	drain	your	trust	fund	...
you	're	not	the	only	one	with	a	job	,	you	know	?
but	you	might	be	able	to	find	out	with	this	.
i	completely	understand	if	you	wanted	to	dip	your	toes	in	the	private
we	're	all	made	up	of	the	same	stuff	,	are	n't	we	?
how	could	she	change	the	face	her	parents	gave	her	?
looking	to	kick	your	ass	after	you	spouted	your	little	conspiracy	theories	.
which	led	me	to	conclude	that	you	must	be	in	some	trouble	.
you	did	n't	let	me	plan	a	wedding	,	and	i	accepted	that	.
when	that	boy	looked	at	you	with	trust	was	not	the	sensation	of	virtue	.
someone	has	to	get	into	the	castle	,	find	benny	and	keep	char	away	from	edgar	.
can	we	go	home	now	?	we	just	have	one	more	stop	.
i	gave	robbie	my	lipstick	sometimes	.	maybe	he	was	wearing	it	when	the	whole	thing	-
oh	,	do	n't	make	idle	threats	.	it	's	not	an	idle	threat	,	ma	'	am	.
i	should	never	have	let	you	have	the	gear	.
i	'd	have	wrapped	up	a	tory	and	sent	him	to	your	home	by	mail
i	knew	what	to	do	on	the	boat	.	it	did	n't	look	like	it	.
turn	left	onto	w	broad	st	.	to	the	best	western	motor	inn	.
well	,	mr	.	seinfeld	,	i	'm	not	sure	i	understand	why	you	want	a	job	here	.
i	took	out	half	his	outfit	and	put	polo	away	.
i	am	sure	that	you	and	i	would	drift	apart	.
i	have	decided	that	i	would	like	to	accept	your	offer	.
you	know	i	have	serious	money	problems	.	that	's	why	i	hit	up	your	girl	.
well	,	gorgeous	,	you	've	been	rerouted	to	the	office	of	too	frigging	bad	.
well	,	do	n't	wait	for	him	to	make	a	move	.
i	'd	actually	planned	to	get	the	10:30	air	france	flight	.
take	exit	4	(	highway	131	)	from	either	north	or	southbound	.
well	,	i	just	wanted	to	say	that	i	think	you	should	be	arrested	.
even	on	the	world	's	highest	peaks	,	in	the	heart	of	the	himalayas	,
this	is	a	pile	of	stones	and	rocks	.
where	did	i	go	wrong	?	how	shall	i	put	it	?
i	do	.	i	remember	when	my	mother	first	told	me	about	death	.
he	's	the	one	you	'll	be	suing	when	you	develop	sepsis	.
you	'll	have	an	answer	here	today	by	5:00	p.	m.
all	he	's	asking	is	that	we	hold	off	on	the	announcement	until	after	the	election	.
no	,	on	my	mother	's	grave	.	and	you	've	never	been	in	jail	?
i	do	n't	think	any	guy	i	've	dated	has	ever	given	me	flowers	.
you	'll	be	a	senior	next	year	.	you	'll	have	to	study	harder	.
newborn	calves	have	to	be	up	and	running	the	day	they	are	born	.
do	n't	tell	me	you	whack	off	to	the	warriors	.	there	they	are	,
because	anyone	could	see	that	it	was	just	about	to	rain	.
and	you	never	had	no	bugs	until	you	got	here	,	until	after	you	,	until	after	we	...
and	i	'd	be	grateful	if	you	'd	put	that	bible	back	in	my	room	.
for	breakfast	try	our	tasty	hot	waffles	,	fresh	fruit	,	hot	cocoa	,	delicious	pastries	,	bagels	and	more	.
i	mean	it	's	not	like	there	are	n't	any	decent	schools	around	here	,
my	child	,	you	will	have	a	good	and	decent	man	to	raise	you	.
earth	...	?	planet	of	the	revolutions	.	will	you	join	our	cause	?
so	you	do	n't	want	to	take	this	opportunity	to	state	your	employer	's	innocence	?
how	much	does	he	make	?	ugh	,	not	enough	to	be	worth	it	,
what	are	you	doing	?	oh	,	my	god	!	he	shoved	me	!
so	,	i	was	thinking	that	you	and	i	should	do	an	interview	sometime	.
if	you	are	seen	to	take	the	initiative	with	the	anc	-
i	used	to	think	it	was	just	'	'	you	out	there	.	the	viewers	.
do	you	want	the	money	or	do	n't	you	?	you	know	what	i	want	.
do	you	know	how	much	i	'd	want	to	do	that	.
joey	beevo	said	it	was	important	.	said	to	give	it	to	him	myself	.
we	have	an	expert	in	ids	who	has	a	kid	in	a	coma	.
it	was	nice	to	see	him	get	his	dirty	for	once	.
i	thought	you	could	probably	figure	it	out	for	yourself	.
you	're	two	years	sober	,	you	kicked	the	shit	out	of	your	demons	.
i	was	hitting	on	foosball	all	night	and	he	was	totally	ignoring	me	.
i	'd	go	out	of	my	mind	.
yo	,	watch	that	shit	on	my	head	.	man	,	it	ricocheted	off	the	fucking	camera	.
the	only	thing	i	hate	more	than	animals	is	teenagers	!
his	wife	said	that	he	was	helping	his	kid	karate	.
what	do	you	mean	it	was	there	and	it	was	n't	?
each	will	be	led	by	a	man	who	has	actually	lived	in	america	.
but	the	man	i	knew	would	n't	try	to	destroy	a	universe	.
so	,	if	the	boyfriend	did	n't	pick	her	up	,	who	'd	she	leave	with	?
as	for	me	personally	,	i	look	forward	to	working	with	each	and	every	one	of	you	...
well	,	you	know	i	think	you	're	lucky	to	be	rid	of	pam	with
to	live	through	the	winters	when	the	ground	is	covered	in	snow	,
foreign	currency	exchange	at	front	desk	only	usd	up	to	$	100.00	.
it	was	wild	,	and	by	some	miracle	,	we	managed	to	swerve	around	the	accident	in	the	road	,
so	that	we	can	put	an	end	to	this	threat	.
when	the	lights	went	down	and	the	screen	flickered	on	...
if	saunders	was	having	a	relationship
i	like	being	around	him	.	then	tell	him	that	,	i	beg	of	you	.
with	an	old	man	who	was	so	full	of	hate	-
come	on	,	now	.	i	'm	in	this	hellhole	for	less	than	that	.
can	i	see	her	?	it	's	gon	na	be	a	little	while	.
i	hate	it	when	people	say	that	,	but	it	is	the	truth	.
oh	,	my	god	!	i	would	love	to	!	i	'm	just	so	flattered	you	'd	ask
well	,	first	things	first	.	i	have	to	find	our	rental	car	.
like	bill	briggs	,	like	the	first	extreme	skiers	around	chamonix	,
are	you	guys	sure	you	're	okay	?	oh	,	yeah	.	yeah	.
if	you	look	at	the	milky	way	galaxy	and	the	andromeda	galaxy
i	did	n't	buy	these	for	my	old	age	.	i	bought	them	to	wear	.
thank	me	for	not	killing	you	and	throwing	you	in	that	dumpster	over	there	.
you	have	to	go	to	school	.	you	have	to	eat	your	vegetables	.
what	are	you	doing	,	man	?	have	you	lost	your	mind	?
from	now	on	,	the	couple	has	but	a	single	goal	:
and	i	demand	you	remove	these	men	from	this	room	.
a	sex	tiebreaker	!	that	is	what	you	need	to	do	!
i	think	that	this	will	fit	in	my	purse	and	,	um	...
and	my	opening	statement	is	gon	na	fall	flat	at	the	most	important	point	,
father	,	stephen	lyman	,	this	is	...	these	are	my	friends	from	america
you	'll	be	able	to	draw	a	picture	of	the	killer	.
what	do	you	want	?	i	have	an	offer	.	are	you	interested	?
bruising	does	n't	suggest	that	,	and	all	the	wounds	are	postmortem	.
it	's	just	-	i	ca	n't	.	it	's	a	sculpture	.	i	just	ca	n't	.
if	rio	had	to	rely	on	the	regular	police	force	only	,
i	command	you	to	destroy	the	projector	by	taking	all	the	necessary	decisions	.
please	stop	it	,	okay	.	we	're	gon	na	try	to	have	a	normal	night	tonight	.
you	get	your	hands	on	one	of	them	,	we	can	shut	up	shop	.	retire	.
i	meant	to	leave	right	after	lunch	,	but	-	i	've	lots	of	amusing	things	to	tell	you	.
it	's	not	just	about	x	's	and	o	's	.	it	's	about	heart	,
uh	,	mrs	kinney	...	she	's	gon	na	tell	you	that	this	is	a	cute	room
except	at	some	point	,	you	saw	fit	to	take	them	off	.
it	was	an	accident	,	i	think	it	might	have	been
massive	fatness	,	like	,	you	know	,	rolls	on	your	back	,	really	big	thighs	.
if	i	do	n't	reappear	by	sundown	,	make	your	way	back	to	florence	without	me	.
ah	,	i	used	to	watch	it	every	week	.	oh	.	yeah	!
well	,	i	could	be	wrong	.	so	the	game	is	on	?
hey	,	zack	,	that	employee	of	the	month	thing	is	n't	really	working	out	for	you	,	is	it	?
when	he	was	introduced	at	the	sorbonne	,	he	was	introduced	by	a
there	's	absolutely	nothing	you	have	that	i	could	possibly	want	.
when	you	write	,	you	get	this	stunned	look	on	your	face	like	you	stuck	a	fork	in	a	toaster	.
this	smoker	-	friendly	room	comes	with	a	delightful	king	bed	on	which	you	can	spread	out	easily	and	relax	.
poket	monster	,	x	-	man	,	frankenstein	...	mature	choices	of	vocabulary	!
a	rank	a	miserable	little	worm	like	yourself	could	never	hope	to	achieve	.
do	you	mind	going	back	to	the	storeroom	and	getting	some	more	bandages	,	please	?
hey	,	no	sleeping	in	.	it	's	time	to	get	back	to	work	.
hey	,	what	's	that	on	your	jacket	?	is	that	the	purina	logo	?
stress	can	exacerbate	abdominal	pain	.	please	,	doctor	,	do	n't	encourage	him	.
now	put	your	tail	between	your	legs	and	get	lost	.
i	know	you	're	enjoying	the	double	dip	with	your	old	pal	,	but	...
and	only	something	like	one	ten	thousandths	of	the	surface
this	mobility	accessible	,	ground	floor	room	is	non	-	smoking	and	comes	with	a	delightfully	comfortable	assisted	bath	tub	.
huh	.	well	,	i	've	got	a	couple	hours	free	this	afternoon	.
even	if	i	hope	these	people	do	n't	call	me	like	that
no	,	i	guess	we	're	just	really	all	going	our	separate	ways	.
i	sift	through	the	applicants	,	judging	their	spelling	and	grammar	.
come	by	the	house	sometime	.	let	's	have	a	family	dinner	.
i	know	,	but	have	n't	you	ever	said	something	dumb	to	lily	that	you	wish	she	would	just	forget	?
liquid	bar	,	on	premises	,	bar	/	lounge	,	international	,	open	for	:	lunch	,	dinner	,	bar	meals	.
i	absolve	you	,	in	the	name	of	the	father	,	son	and	holy	ghost	.	go	in	peace	.
it	was	a	seven	night	.	-	oh	,	give	me	a	break	.
she	would	n't	have	killed	for	just	300	million	.	she	killed	?
keep	the	remains	secure	while	i	speak	to	my	superiors	.
because	you	wanted	to	humiliate	me	in	the	eyes	of	the	world	.
now	,	you	know	i	ca	n't	let	you	do	that	,	lieutenant	.
he	had	some	interactions	with	the	local	tribe	's	people	and	had
do	you	think	this	may	have	been	done	to	you	on	purpose	?
do	you	think	he	's	targeting	one	of	the	women	?	-	could	be	.
but	you	kind	of	made	it	quite	good	,	and	i	think	...
what	do	you	think	was	holding	them	up	there	,	you	muppet	?	.
spock	was	right	.	-	we	all	felt	exactly	the	same	.
well	,	he	's	112	years	old	.	i	bring	him	his	medicine	every	week	.
oh	,	the	one	that	gavin	's	always	talking	about	.	she	's	pretty	.
i	would	like	to	apologize	for	the	abruptness	of	your	removal	from	your	homes	and	your	offices	.
and	i	'm	supposed	to	keep	an	eye	on	you	?	other	than	that	.
i	do	n't	have	time	to	be	one	of	your	little	projects	.
i	've	been	in	surgery	for	11	hours	,	been	on	my	feet	for	36	.
so	i	have	to	do	like	...	it	's	not	strong	enough	,	but	i	will	try	.
i	mean	,	that	line	is	a	boxer	-	dropper	if	ever	i	heard	one	.
chris	!	but	all	you	do	is	watch	hilarious	clips	of	fat	kids	on	roller	coasters	.
this	is	the	stuff	my	mother	used	to	tell	her	friends	about	.
she	must	have	been	very	fond	of	you	,	sick	people	have	such	deep	,	sincere	attachments	.
trouble	?	no	,	i	just	want	to	talk	to	the	guy	...
well	,	that	all	depends	on	how	much	it	will	cost	to	get	it	all	up	and	working	.
but	you	'd	rather	spend	the	night	with	me	in	the	stables	.	not	in	the	room
we	're	out	of	the	starlet	blue	.	we	're	out	,	we	're	out	.
i	'm	sorry	that	i	missed	the	meeting	but	i	fainted	,
so	the	last	guy	who	got	taller	,	he	did	n't	even	take	it	,	so	...
your	dad	's	sidelining	me	,	kim	.	he	's	making	me	sit	out	.
porterage	/	bell	services	,	are	available	from	9:00	a.m.	to	9:00	p.m
i	'm	still	waiting	for	some	bastard	to	tell	me	what	happened	.
go	work	for	the	stupid	bank	and	just	be	happy	.
sorry	about	all	that	other	stuff	,	but	you	never	know	who	to	trust	.
i	finally	got	something	nice	where	the	a.c	.	actually	works	.	toss	it	.
yeah	,	do	us	proud	,	you	know	.	beat	the	skirts	off	those	300	other	girls	.
but	i	guess	because	no	one	ever	done	that	before	here
pompeii	-	and	i	kid	you	not	-	is	the	model
if	there	's	anyone	in	this	world	that	i	could	love	,	it	's	you	.
if	the	wind	shifts	substantially	during	the	next	few	hours	,
yeah	,	i	-	i	kind	of	hoisted	a	few	.	dozen	.
and	you	said	there	was	no	reason	to	tell	her
and	was	spread	,	by	meat	or	milk	of	infected	animals	;
you	deliberately	arranged	it	so	that	he	would	n't	come	.	how	clever	of	me	!
if	i	can	just	get	this	job	i	will	be	happy	forever	.
i	feel	like	saying	in	front	of	me	,	my	goodness	.
there	's	going	to	be	a	lot	more	singing	and	dancing	when	we	get	to	high	school	.
cos	he	's	gone	for	the	head	shot	eight	out	of	11	times	?
do	you	have	any	idea	what	it	's	like	to	go	to	bed	every	night
and	you	did	n't	just	come	here	to	give	me	grief	.
we	'll	get	our	miracle	.	i	mean	,	she	's	gon	na	wake	up	.
yes	,	it	is	.	-	your	honor	,	as	you	can	see	,
is	the	blue	cheese	they	give	you	with	the	wings	?
not	that	i	blame	him	because	i	'm	in	this	pissy	mood	all	the	time
do	n't	look	at	me	like	that	.	it	were	n't	my	fault	.
our	air	strikes	will	take	out	whatever	defenses	they	've	got	.
because	it	's	in	your	head	.	and	if	it	's	in	your	head	,	it	's	in	mine	!
and	what	,	or	who	,	will	we	find	when	we	arrive	?
you	ca	n't	count	on	it	he	's	trying	to	save	his	own	skin
have	you	had	trouble	with	gulls	?	one	of	my	boats	did	,	last	week	.
what	do	you	mean	?	-	come	here	,	look	at	this	.
in	mormonism	,	actually	a	lot	of	their	theologist	is	directly	related	to	this	idea	of	god
but	in	the	spirit	of	fair	play	,	which	is	the	hallmark	of	my	administration	...
a	lot	of	it	was	destroyed	then	and	has	been	rebuilt	,	but	...
we	hit	key	wards	in	the	north	,	northwest	and	west	side	.
so	i	could	n't	expect	she	would	let	me	stay	home	,
and	when	parking	along	a	curb	on	an	uphill	slope	,
and	we	'd	talk	and	eat	dim	sum	,	then	i	'd	take	you	home	.
why	,	then	,	absolutely	no	one	in	the	world	is	safe	?
oh	,	i	'm	sorry	that	i	would	like	to	have	a	nice	10th	birthday	party	.
we	'll	be	a	week	in	florence	!	i	've	got	the	tickets	!
i	know	you	did	n't	sign	up	for	a	lot	of	this
i	mean	,	why	could	n't	i	just	be	quiet	,	keep	my	job	?
okay	.	i	see	what	you	're	doing	here	,	you	're	putting	me	on	the	spot	.
yeah	,	probably	inflicted	when	she	was	trying	to	run	away	.
can	i	take	it	to	my	room	?	just	do	n't	let	it	bite	your	nose	off	.
is	the	judge	's	pick	for	best	photo	of	the	week	ap	will	be	displayed
should	i	turn	away	if	you	guys	want	to	look	down	...	?
if	you	're	trying	to	blackmail	me	...	it	's	not	going	to	work	.
it	's	only	a	local	call	.	we	ca	n't	call	her	up	now	.	it	's	nearly	3:00	a.m.
so	may	i	ask	,	is	there	no	other	alternative	here	?
cause	you	scratch	the	surface	,	you	'll	find	the	dirt	underneath	.
they	wo	n't	stop	and	inspect	the	vehicle	if	i	'm	driving	.
the	incas	boasted	that	manco	had	made	this	the	strongest	fortress	in	all	peru	,
i	can	not	do	shit	with	those	guns	.	you	know	what	,	cortez	?
why	would	you	wanna	be	the	same	as	everybody	else	?
i	'm	an	interpreter	for	companies	who	do	business	in	japan	,
well	,	my	big	,	dangerous	adventure	for	tonight	is	gon	na	be	doing	the	dishes	in	the	ocean	.
once	upon	a	time	,	there	was	a	king	and	a	queen	,
if	you	tell	her	,	you	'll	be	the	guy	who	told	her	boyfriend	is	cheating	.
and	the	only	time	he	feels	sure	about	himself	is	when	he	's	performing	on	the	dance	floor	.
but	mi	-	sook	will	be	suspended	for	not	showing	up	for	a	week	.
you	are	in	the	powered	position	.	you	could	take	her	back	if	you	wanted	.
you	just	as	well	get	you	a	grizzly	bear	,	an	orangutan	.
and	sometimes	i	am	a	little	tired	come	friday	night	...
thank	you	all	for	once	again	entrusting	me	with	this	high	office	of	civil	service	.
she	was	supposed	to	have	killed	herself	a	long	time	ago	.
yo	,	nick	,	i	go	out	on	a	limb	to	get	you	this	job	,	like	i	always	do	-
hey	,	not	me	,	but	i	do	have	a	great	idea	.
and	would	be	like	standing	next	to	hiroshima	all	over	the	world	.
do	n't	call	me	that	.	only	my	mother	called	me	that	.
she	feels	assured	of	herself	and	enjoys	life	once	more	,
last	time	i	saw	him	,	he	was	trying	to	take	his	research	with	him	.
know	what	's	worse	than	a	fruit	fly	,	ray	?	a	murderer	.
the	mayor	's	office	and	the	police	department	know	more	than	they	're	letting	on	?	stay	tune	...
one	that	you	could	tie	-	ls	this	wide	enough	?
there	's	a	microwave	and	refrigerator	in	every	room	of	our	murdo	hotel	,	which	makes	extended	stays	simple	.
i	would	never	do	such	a	thing	,	nor	do	i	feel	the	need	.
including	outstanding	guest	actor	and	actress	in	a	comedy	series	.
i	would	have	spent	my	entire	life	in	this	pod	as	some	type	of	bio	-	computer	.
you	can	count	on	our	help	,	sir	.	-	shall	i	alert	dr	.	mccoy	?
uh	,	it	's	a	we	it	it
you	do	n't	want	to	go	upstairs	'	cause	you	get	scared	.
that	take	the	death	of	one	of	our	own	personally	.
so	rather	than	a	boring	press	interview	,	why	do	n't	you	come	on	up	to	the	gallery	,
start	your	day	with	a	buffet	of	hot	and	cold	cereals	,	a	waffle	station	,	fresh	fruits	and	favorite	pastries	.
if	marriage	worked	,	i	'd	be	for	it	.	do	you	know	the	divorce	rate	?
just	dropping	and	off	.	any	thoughts	on	who	sent	the	envelope	?
mr	la	fleur	,	this	is	doris	from	the	department	of	water	and	power	.
so	no	crew	of	mine	will	ever	walk	away	knowing	a	mark	has	got	the	better	of	us	.
i	think	that	is	it	'cause	you	're	not	even	back	in	this	house	for	a	day	...
is	there	another	book	,	or	a	sequel	?	maybe	a	night	fury	pamphlet	?
careful	,	doctor	.	others	are	willing	to	pay	more	than	you	.
i	never	tried	to	pretend	that	i	was	anything	else	.
good	,	you	can	be	a	beater	on	the	hunt	,	we	're	short	of	a	man	or	two	.
it	took	a	half	an	hour	to	get	the	mask	on	the	kid	for	the	lung	scan	.
we	lost	her	.	what	else	do	you	need	to	know	?
sergeant	,	this	is	dr	.	samantha	grimm	,	the	uac	science	officer	.
i	'm	picking	you	up	for	an	afternoon	of	puppet	theater	in	the	park	.
okay	,	you	've	got	to	give	me	a	clue	.	i	just	did	.
did	i	mention	the	really	snappy	swimsuits	?	i	'll	think	about	it	.
i	had	this	nightmare	where	joe	was	looking	up	at	me	.
clock	with	portable	mp3	adapter	,	in	-	room	safe	for	most	laptops	,	microwave	,	refrigerator	,	coffee	maker	.
but	as	far	as	the	innermost	thoughts	of	the	field	agents	are	concerned	,
the	menu	outside	the	door	has	lots	of	good	dishes	.
you	said	you	wanted	to	get	up	early	to	study	,
the	only	person	to	request	the	file	.	mr	.	laurentin	,	margot	's	father	.
behave	,	my	job	means	a	lot	to	me	and	i	recommended	you	.
are	you	kidding	me	?	at	least	he	did	n't	have	his	fucking	hands	all	over	you	.
that	he	did	n't	need	the	words	if	he	could	get	the	listener
the	most	dangerous	criminal	mind	the	world	has	ever	seen	,
then	we	'll	keep	dialing	in	through	the	night	at	the	very	least	.
the	thing	i	said	to	you	in	the	hotel	,	the	mommy	comment	,	that	was	a	lousy	thing	to	say	.
if	he	do	n't	want	to	be	a	witness	,	he	does	n't	have	to	be	a	witness	.
hmm	?	the	list	of	stuff	i	just	went	through	,	any	questions	?
and	his	hobbies	include	stamp	collecting	and	the	yo	-	yo	.
i	know	it	's	scary	to	bet	on	yourself	,	but	if	you	do	n't	,	nobody	else	will	.
as	soon	as	the	sun	sets	every	evening	you	drink	with	your	cronies
i	've	got	some	personal	stuff	going	on	in	my	life	,
2.00	mile(s	)	from	javelina	cantina	,	full	service	,	mexican	,	open	for	:	lunch	,	dinner	.
you	hurt	any	of	these	people	,	i	'll	stop	cooperating	,	and	then	you	'll	have	to	kill	me	.
he	is	the	nicest	guy	ever	.	i	'm	a	terrible	person	.
enjoy	a	paseo	,	that	's	spain	's	traditional	stroll	,	with	the	local	crowd	down	run	mayor
he	does	n't	like	the	idea	that	his	agents	are	being	taunted	,
imagine	kneeling	down	in	prayer	and	then	-	whack	.	amazing	.
and	i	thought	that	,	uh	,	antacids	were	all	i	needed	.
i	met	a	doctor	who	says	there	is	a	new	and	better	way	of	treating	it	.
my	guess	is	he	'll	try	to	cut	a	deal	.	resign	without	a	fight	in	exchange	for	clemency	.
he	wanted	to	jump	off	a	bridge	2	hours	ago	,	you	know	.
we	've	got	failures	all	over	the	place	!	we	're	taking	on	water	!
yeah	.	and	she	was	having	a	hard	time	getting	from	anchorage	to	seward	,
when	rival	gangs	are	involved	,	it	spills	over	onto	innocent	people	.
major	,	i	'm	ordering	you	to	take	these	men	to	the	choppers	and	evacuate	.
i	know	that	i	am	very	bad	.	i	am	not	a	saint	.
if	you	sell	them	a	ticket	,	they	're	not	getting	a	ride	.
i	could	tell	you	what	to	do	,	but	you	would	n't	do	it	.
just	let	me	know	if	you	guys	are	getting	tired	.
then	these	guys	give	him	a	five	-	dollar	bill	...
and	remember	,	this	gun	is	pointed	right	at	your	heart	.
i	'm	going	home	.	oh	,	no	!	albert	,	please	.	stay	with	us	formancala	hour	.
i	can	prove	it	.	i	'll	take	you	to	the	girl	who	sold	it	to	me	.
especially	when	you	do	n't	smell	like	a	dog	or	a	skunk	.
well	,	if	you	'd	helped	me	when	i	asked	,	we	would	n't	be	having	this	conversation	right	now	.
may	i	have	the	pictures	?
i	've	joined	them	to	help	promote	l.	a.	fashion	week	.
well	,	i	only	had	a	little	lie	down	,	that	is	all	.
yeah	,	i	remember	hearing	shots	,	but	they	do	n't	seem	connected	with	me	.
for	once	,	it	felt	like	coal	wood	was	part	of	the	outside	world	.
i	only	met	the	man	once	.	i	was	a	contractor	.
how	many	guys	we	tell	to	take	a	walk	around	the	block	to	cool	off	?
after	the	divorce	,	jeff	and	i	helped	mom	with	her	new	business	.
i	ca	n't	get	out	this	way	.	i	want	to	get	to	that	door	.
but	if	a	bit	of	chicanery	forced	us	to	explore	other	facets	of	our	relationship
i	'll	have	to	hire	various	builders	...	for	the	plaster	...	the	beams	.
i	thought	you	guys	were	just	seemed	like	naturals	out	there	.
i	will	feel	very	bad	taking	so	much	for	a	work	which	is	not	signed	.
and	yet	you	do	not	know	for	certain	and	you	are	here	.
take	it	on	headfirst	with	the	skills	that	i	will	teach	you	at	work	...
summit	mall	features	shopping	,	fine	dining	,	and	tech	stores	like	the	apple	store
you	've	been	with	another	man	and	you	've	been	with	him	tonight	.
he	's	got	headphones	on	.	hey	,	kid	,	can	you	hear	me	?
yo	,	when	you	first	came	in	here	,	you	was	all	treating	us	straight	up	,
if	you	do	n't	,	they	're	gon	na	kill	you	,	do	you	understand	me	?
what	is	this	,	a	witch	hunt	?	-	oh	,	my	god	.
if	you	start	singing	,	i	'll	start	bitching	,	and	you	do	n't	want	that	.
which	we	can	enjoy	in	wales	on	my	family	's	farm	.
if	the	indians	do	n't	attack	us	tonight	,	i	want	to	start	work	again	tomorrow	.
so	if	he	's	to	be	read	to	it	will	have	to	be	in	his	room	.
but	my	doctor	says	i	'm	doing	great	.	my	tumors	are	virtually	undetectable	.
i	know	it	's	frustrating	,	but	the	key	word	-	live	.
hi	.	-	this	order	came	into	the	shop	for	you	.
i	do	n't	wanna	hear	about	it	.	-	you	will	hear	about	it	!
you	'd	let	me	use	the	key	you	leave	out	for	your	girlfriends	?
i	'm	about	to	shoot	beautiful	woman	and	her	retard	stable	boy	.
i	order	you	to	surrender	in	the	name	of	unit	.	that	's	not	gon	na	work	.
and	my	wife	can	help	me	.	i	can	take	him	.
so	was	it	a	good	,	old	-	fashioned	american	kiss	or	are	we	talking	the	infinitely	superior	french	variety	?
but	years	ago	,	there	were	some	folk	who	got	buried	alive	.
my	daughter	has	a	sore	throat	,	could	be	strep	.	i	need	to	take	her	to	the	doctor	.
all	right	,	cheese	dicks	.	welcome	to	the	nam	.	follow	me	.
your	son	asked	you	to	send	him	to	one	of	the	best	school	in	the	city	,
that	was	an	accident	,	too	.	put	that	on	my	amex	.
and	phrases	that	the	recursive	spider	would	log	on	to	.
especially	since	your	job	is	to	help	people	who	are	in	trouble	.
mm	-	hmm	-	you	can	go	home	.	i	'll	clean	up	this	mess	.
oh	,	come	on	,	you	only	bought	'em	so	you	could	go	to	palm	springs	and	pick	up	lesbians	.
i	'm	gon	na	need	you	to	retask	a	satellite	to	those	coordinates	.
i	'll	play	you	the	voices	while	you	fall	asleep	,	okay	?
she	goes	into	a	lot	of	detail	.	son	of	a	bitch	.
if	a	girl	wore	a	dress	like	that	in	a
so	you	need	to	tell	me	now	,	are	we	clean	?
nothing	happened	.	there	were	no	flashes	,	so	the	cia	guys	are	legit	.
the	world	comes	to	an	end	,	believers	go	up	in	a	spaceship	?
the	consuls	will	present	a	motion	dispatching	you	to	capua	.
put	your	game	face	on	,	suck	it	up	and	mix	in	with	the	community	,	hmm	?
but	i	need	to	know	that	he	actually	has	the	disease	.
you	want	to	find	out	if	the	girl	who	's	been	watching	you	saw	what	you	did	.
he	gave	his	immense	authority	to	the	device	of	a	single	pilaster
baths	feature	a	bathtub	or	shower	,	hairdryer	and	cosmetic	mirror	.
every	business	takes	time	.	-	do	n't	you	have	a	partner	?
and	you	may	have	noticed	that	he	's	also	mentally	challenged	.
he	give	us	one	of	his	one	minute	inspirational	talks	.
the	portal	-	potties	are	for	the	help	.	they	go	over	there	.
but	,	uh	,	caught	you	buying	drinks	at	the	bar	tonight	.
the	charges	were	dropped	because	you	agreed	to	put	yourself	in	a	doctor	's	care	.
i	'm	not	just	a	whimsical	figure
i	'm	michael	portillo	.	hello	.	nice	to	meet	you	.	thanks	for	joining	us	.	great	to	see	you	.
sir	.	everyone	wants	your	name	on	a	hat	,	can	you	sign	these	for	us	?
what	happens	when	dan	does	n't	show	up	?	i	do	n't	know	.
and	became	a	highest	engrossing	star	wars	film	of	all	.
i	'm	sorry	to	tell	you	,	your	mama	is	a	po	-	po	ho	.
and	lead	you	to	a	promised	land	,	you	are	wrong	,	brother	.
and	now	you	guys	think	the	guy	that	attacked	me
hey	,	now	you	can	tell	that	bastard	ex	-	husband	of	yours	what	he	can	do	with	his	ethics	.
you	run	down	this	alley	,	you	try	to	cut	her	off	,
i	was	going	to	be	a	lady	about	this	,	but	let	's	go	!
it	's	so	nice	to	see	you	.	we	won	our	case
i	mean	,	it	might	have	been	awkward	seeing	the	kids	.
this	document	is	only	half	the	battle	.	we	still	need	an	expert	who	can	explain	this	to	a	jury	.
oh	,	yeah	.	sure	.	of	course	.	hey	,	katy	.	how	's	my	girl	?	what	?
that	's	never	great	.	so	,	you	've	got	to	build	really	great	space	.
if	i	say	yes	,	will	you	leave	me	alone	,	even	at	the	fair	?
that	's	right	.	a	new	form	of	aids	which	is	resistant	to	drugs	.
i	can	arrange	a	trade	.	like	acine	,	kenosha	,	south	bend	?
oh	,	sorry	!	l	thought	you	were	out	.	i	was	round	nana	's	but	the	water	's	off	.
inside	district	one	,	however	,	we	believe	you	'll	be	pleasantly	surprised	.
with	blocked	rooms	and	easy	airport	access	,	traveling	for	work	has	never	been	easier	.
i	'll	take	you	,	but	your	sister	changed	the	wiring	scheme	.	it	's	one	of	her	fail	-	safes	.
whether	you	prefer	the	traditional	texas	bucking	schools	or	natural	beauty	,	there	's	plenty	to	be	had	nearby	.
and	they	throw	it	out	the	window	to	see	how	it	lands	.
last	thing	you	're	going	to	want	to	find	out	about	is	the	brothers	killing	somebody	else
when	i	found	him	,	he	was	talking	all	kinds	of	crazy	about	...
i	do	n't	care	about	that	dump	,	you	can	have	it	for	free	.
do	you	remember	the	night	that	you	walked	her	home	?
she	was	gon	na	go	out	of	her	way	to	piss	'	em	off	.
yeah	,	well	,	maybe	not	for	you	,	but	for	the	hospital	,	it	sure	as	hell	was	.
we	will	go	to	the	field	and	pick	up	flowers	.
dangerously	close	to	admitting	you	committed	a	felony	be	.
i	had	a	great	time	with	these	two	on	the	beach	.
so	i	do	n't	need	to	be	a	therapist	to	see	that	that	's	erratic	behavior	.
you	're	in	a	lot	of	trouble	.	we	know	you	drove	the	second	vehicle	,	the	green	truck	.
at	times	i	might	hold	some	of	the	discussions	for	the	class	,
it	'd	just	be	a	drink	.	you	'll	be	home	faster	than	you	can	say	"	jack	robinson	"	.
andy	,	get	into	bed	.	i	'll	be	in	to	tuck	you	in	.
pockets	were	n't	turned	out	so	i	did	n't	think	it	was	a	robbery	.
i	know	it	's	not	easy	.	i	do	n't	like	it	either	.
there	were	some	pm	10s	in	her	lungs	.	you	know	,	some	other	trace	element	.
we	had	other	things	planned	to	do	and	now	we	ca	n't	do	them	,	so	it	's	just	another	chugach	notch	.
i	'm	supposed	to	ask	you	the	most	embarrassing	question	i	can	think	of	?	uh	-	huh	.
and	all	that	loyalty	,	and	all	that	trust	will	no	longer	exist	for	you
and	it	can	infect	cervix	and	urethra	of	women	and	men
i	like	them	all	.	they	have	different	styles	.	fun	to	watch	.
the	uniqueness	of	our	property	is	a	big	reason	many	guests	choose	to	stay	with	us	.
great	thought	was	taken	as	to	where	to	touch	her	.
100	miles	from	yosemite	national	park	,	world	renown	national	park	.
you	're	not	going	to	throw	him	back	into	quarantine	,	are	you	?
i	know	it	's	a	well	-	worn	passage	.	not	very	original	.
yes	,	it	could	be	a	torn	ligament	,	which	is	more	serious	than	a	broken	bone	.
has	n't	brought	a	major	new	product	to	market	since	1997	.
four	that	wanna	own	me	two	that	wanna	stone	me
undercover	unit	tried	to	,	but	we	managed	to	shake	the	tail	.
i	asked	,	it	does	n't	come	in	purple	-	no	,	that	's	not	the	problem	,	i	...
if	they	would	've	executed	it	in	a	beautiful	way	with	beautiful	materials	,
i	was	gently	trying	to	push	you	out	of	the	nest	.
i	have	taken	a	new	apartment	.	i	'm	sitting	on	the	balcony	.
but	i	ca	n't	remember	where	i	left	my	car	last	night	.
yeah	,	i	was	on	the	phone	with	her	at	the	time	.
we	have	got	to	stop	interrupting	each	other	all	the	time	.
tonight	,	we	change	things	up	and	the	competition	gets	even	tougher	.
who	is	the	odd	man	out	in	a	family	and	office	environment
he	will	last	you	some	eight	year	or	nine	year	.
because	i	'm	free	if	you	want	to	catch	a	flick	.
i	've	been	through	the	missing	persons	records	a	dozen	times	.
outdoor	pool	heated	seasonally	open	9:00	a.m.	to	9:00	p.m.	from	may	through	october
you	're	doing	this	for	the	same	reason	i	'm	doing	this	.
he	's	not	the	man	you	thought	he	was	.	trust	me	.
there	was	a	second	set	of	tire	tracks	behind	it
if	i	intervene	,	if	i	hurt	him	,	he	will	hate	me	.
if	you	were	n't	there	with	me	i	could	n't	go	on	.
he	's	always	parading	around	in	front	of	them	like	a	rooster	,
with	every	single	dive	to	the	deep	ocean	scientists	are	discovering	new	species	,
you	have	to	believe	me	.	people	have	to	believe	me	.
what	could	i	do	?	i	went	next	door	,	we	finally	got	him	to	stop	.
yeah	,	that	or	the	thing	that	happened	at	the	wedding	.
the	fact	that	we	made	fire	that	quickly	,	it	reassured	us	all	that	you	know	what	?
they	do	n't	understand	ventilation	and	in	ventilation	you	bring	in	cold	air	,	you	heat	it	,
he	did	n't	want	his	people	to	know	he	did	n't	have	the	weapons	.
okay	.	now	this	will	just	take	some	of	the	sting	out	.
now	,	the	walk	through	says	i	dump	the	ammo	and	the	boss	dies	,
we	know	that	you	still	got	meat	in	that	freezer	of	yours	.	yeah	.
you	know	,	i	thought	i	made	myself	pretty	damn	clear
and	the	kind	of	place	that	she	needs	to	be	in	does	n't	come	cheap	.
they	're	the	ones	that	i	got	to	see	on	tv	,	crying	,
well	,	i	say	we	let	him	run	all	the	way	down	the	road	with	it	.
duty	roster	on	the	safe	house	shows	that	it	was	only	vacant
if	i	did	n't	become	a	cop	-	his	cop	-	he	'd	kill	me	.
mom	says	not	to	forget	your	homework	.	i	did	it	already	.
is	something	wrong	?	i	can	fix	it	,	i	'm	good	at	that	stuff	.
he	was	riding	the	high	horse	with	some	little	cocktail	waitress	from	miami	shores	.
so	i	'll	just	keep	my	eyes	open	at	all	times	.
and	they	all	lived	happily	ever	after	for	at	least	6	months	.
well	,	now	it	's	my	turn	to	be	surprised	.	what	does	he	say	?
she	'll	only	have	body	image	issues	if	she	keeps	gaining	weight	.
do	n't	put	it	out	.	it	's	$	40	.	i	'm	sorry	.	ic	-	ca	n't	.
i	mean	,	did	you	see	what	he	was	doing	,	did	you	hear	him	?
you	want	to	get	on	,	l	know	.	maurice	is	waiting	.
and	much	too	valuable	to	be	kept	in	the	hands	of	mere	autobots	.
he	was	a	merchant	sailor	.	a	respectable	man	who	obeyed	the	law	.
oh	,	you	're	pissed	off	?	i	'm	the	one	drinking	crystal	light	with	dinner	!
hey	,	are	you	trying	to	wall	paper	the	house	with	these	?
well	,	i	did	consider	throwing	a	dart	at	the	real	thing	,
i	could	have	been	like	that	,	because	i	had	skills	,	but	no	.
and	still	it	's	hard	to	take	my	eyes	off	her	.
why	do	i	become	an	eight	year	old	around	him	?
i	was	thinking	that	you	might	want	to	offer	her
you	know	i	sort	of	have	already	done	the	assistant	thing	.
and	into	my	new	life	,	so	this	is	to	the	car	,
our	majestic	,	bark	-	covered	friends	exhale	life	-	giving	oxygen	.
of	course	,	yeah	.	would	you	like	to	talk	to	a	girl	?
and	when	we	do	meet	,	old	man	,	it	's	you	i	want	to	see	,
boy	,	how	am	i	gon	na	tell	my	mom	about	this	?
and	she	lashed	out	at	me	.	yeah	,	and	you	lashed	back
fuck	off	!	i	'm	not	sitting	in	the	toilets	all	day	.
i	'd	love	to	,	but	i	've	got	sniffles	in	seven	and	bed	-	wetting	in	six	.
is	to	require	every	team	member	to	file	mission	reports	,
the	publisher	put	out	a	couple	dozen	before	going	bankrupt	.
you	're	saying	your	father	and	brother	were	sitting	here	when	the	gun	went	off	?
what	are	you	trying	to	do	to	me	?
what	did	you	want	to	be	when	you	grew	up	?
you	can	see	by	the	photo	that	the	back	door	was	closed	,
but	i	guarantee	you	,	it	's	no	fun	in	the	tub	.
yeah	,	i	just	came	to	tell	you	breakfast	was	ready	.
the	maple	leaf	festival	is	a	beloved	annual	favorite	that	everyone	looks	forward	to	.
yeah	?	-	we	are	stuck	inside	.	we	need	the	new	code	.
the	only	reason	that	you	're	even	talking	about	a	house	is	to	make	me	feel	bad	.
i	really	would	prefer	that	this	whole	apology	thing	took	place	a	little	more	publicly	.
why	did	n't	you	say	anything	?	i	thought	about	what	you	said	.
can	we	talk	about	something	else	?	nothing	wrong	with	a	maid	.
i	did	write	to	your	daughter	advising	her	that	she	might	be	in	breach	of	security	.
our	two	queen	bed	bedroom	is	one	of	our	largest	rooms	with	375	square	feet	.
and	he	's	still	out	there	,	and	he	's	taken	our	daughter	.
of	course	,	i	'd	love	to	see	you	as	a	crater	.
well	,	washing	up	liquid	is	something	you	clean	the	dishes	with	in	the	u.	k.
and	then	i	look	up	and	see	her	in	the	shower	.
if	the	thing	you	wanna	advice	about	is	pizza	toppings	or	burning	sensation	when	you	pee	.
so	your	problem	is	your	boyfriend	to	spend	time	with	you	?
if	he	dumped	the	body	into	the	air	-	conditioning	unit	.
you	want	me	to	go	and	speak	for	you	.	yeah	.
it	's	possible	he	could	have	set	it	up	a	week	ago	.
i	read	all	about	the	kiss	me	not	killer	case	,
and	i	'm	going	to	have	to	ask	you	to	...	scoot	off	.
blood	spatter	,	angle	of	the	trajectory	,	position	of	the	body	.
hey	,	this	is	hank	.	i	must	be	out	,	so	leave	a	message	at	the	beep	.
he	suggests	that	their	target	should	not	be	an	enemy	of	the	country	...
but	he	could	grow	his	own	food	,	so	he	went	back	.
i	've	been	looking	all	over	for	you	.	i	got	ta	get	outta	here	pronto	,
lay	off	your	ma	,	please	.	this	is	tough	enough	on	everybody	.	come	on	.
today	we	also	say	good	bye	to	our	young	adult	ministry	.
over	the	past	14	semesters	,	87.3%/	of	all	campus	-	event	funding
i	could	n't	stand	to	spin	her	like	that	.	how	'd	she	take	it	?
all	right	,	so	everybody	has	to	be	here	at	5:30	to	rehearse	our	house	of	horrors	.
you	know	all	the	players	,	and	you	have	all	the	files	.
but	while	we	may	all	be	talking	about	my	vindication	...
sell	me	a	plot	on	the	edge	of	the	site	.	say	,	50,000	.
i	've	noticed	she	is	a	woman	with	a	slight	personality	.
with	that	in	mind	,	on	average	we	're	discovering	about	four	a	month	.
it	's	not	gon	na	be	any	bigger	than	this	fucking	goddamn	booth	!
we	would	only	interrupt	such	beautiful	music	for	something	truly	important	.
you	did	say	you	did	n't	see	that	much	of	her	after	that	night	.
and	the	way	his	eyes	kept	looking	at	me	slowly	going	up	and	down	my	body
no	,	we	're	working	here	.	now	,	do	n't	turn	the	tv	on	.
do	i	really	have	to	sit	in	back	from	now	on	?
what	do	you	think	i	'm	gon	na	do	?	i	do	n't	know	.
i	'm	a	stockbroker	.	i	'd	lose	my	license	.	do	n't	be	such	an	ass	,	go	help	him	.
your	son	plays	an	awful	lot	of	blackjack	,	ma	'	am	.
when	i	say	so	,	we	're	gon	na	turn	around	and	run	like	hell	.
just	to	work	his	guts	out	in	that	damn	cane	until	he	drops	.
and	you	know	i	tripped	over	my	dog	and	i	went	smack	into	the	the	bathroom	door	.
but	for	some	reason	,	my	daughter	and	my	grandson	do	.
but	now	i	know	what	it	looks	like	and	he	can	never	take	that	away	.
but	i	can	give	you	this	pitch	in	one	minute	.	no	,	he	's	going	to	meet	with	you	later	.
because	of	our	complete	devotion	to	a	set	of	ideals	.

you	'll	have	the	whole	day	to	play	where	you	want	.
because	every	major	convict	released	from	a	sausage	prison	in	six	months
since	i	came	here	as	an	officer	of	the	law	-
aii	the	computers	are	down	.	we	even	had	some	trouble	finding	your	records	.
in	this	world	you	have	to	go	out	and	get	what	you	want	.	follow	me	?
but	i	suppose	whatever	's	in	that	egg	,	it	ai	n't	one	of	us	.
you	start	going	off	on	a	walk	and	you	never	know	where	it	'll	lead	.
i	was	an	art	history	major	in	college	.	it	's	the	only	thing	i	'm	good	at	.
adjacent	to	subway	?	,	deli	,	american	,	open	for	:	lunch	,	dinner	,	located	next	door	.

and	i	'm	being	sincere	.	this	is	the	way	to	go
take	two	liters	out	of	each	fuel	tank	.	there	's	a	central	purge	.
if	he	says	he	wrote	it	.
i	'm	a	romantic	.	i	know	what	i	heard	.	you	have	no	idea	what	that	poem	was	.
it	was	the	grand	street	library	,	second	floor	reading	room	.
what	are	you	talking	about	?	they	chop	up	the	fish	into	sticks	-
to	stand	in	a	smoky	,	stinky	sauna	of	a	dive
oh	!	these	would	look	so	nice	in	the	new	place	.
sometimes	my	brother	would	help	out	and	then	we	'd	kick	some	serious	ass	.
i	just	took	a	practice	quiz	and	realized	i	had	a	lot	more	studying	to	do	.
i	've	seen	you	here	before	.	you	're	always	in	such	a	rush	.
and	i	know	that	you	're	extra	strong	.	only	not	as	strong	.
he	isolated	her	,	pushed	away	everyone	so	that	he	would	be	the	only	one	she	had	left	.
when	i	'm	out	there	,	as	long	as	i	do	n't	mess	up	.
if	you	want	to	hear	me	say	“	sorry	”	，	you	'd	better	change	your	name	to	sorry
she	keeps	her	lips	so	tight	she	could	n't	floss	between	them	.
it	was	in	the	newspapers	,	it	was	all	over	the	press
you	do	n't	go	into	a	knife	fight	without	taking	your	knife	.
i	ca	n't	see	a	thing	.	if	you	're	looking	,	you	are	so	fired	!
hey	,	who	wants	a	burger	?	it	's	okay	,	i	just	washed	my	paws	.
one	of	my	guys	took	it	for	a	test	drive	when	it	opened	last	week	.
i	mean	i	always	thought	she	was	kind	of	boring	.
so	why	do	n't	you	just	tell	me	what	the	hell	this	is	all	about	.
thomas	,	what	happened	?	where	's	alex	?	he	's	off	in	search	of	coffee	.
i	'd	only	wanted	to	be	yan	-	sen	's	partner	in	life
when	you	check	out	,	i	will	give	you	the	work	proof	to	you
so	there	may	be	a	dead	body	in	the	car	when	i	get	there	.	that	's	just	a	heads	up	.
so	you	two	still	a	couple	?	no	,	not	since	senior	prom	.
where	the	hell	are	you	?	-	i	'm	taking	'	care	of	things
because	we	're	friends	and	we	've	been	through	so	much	together	,	i	'm	gon	na	let	this	is	go	...
i	just	found	you	a	secret	lab	full	of	really	cool	ancient	stuff	.
when	i	get	into	it	...	when	i	have	a	song	i	can	get	into	like	that	,
undisciplined	,	as	childish	as	your	7	year	old	classmates	!
look	,	i	'm	telling	you	,	this	guy	is	as	solid	as	they	come	.
if	i	do	n't	say	i	did	n't	do	it	,	they	're	not	...
i	saw	her	this	morning	,	round	the	corner	,	at	boston	park	.
the	only	thing	you	catch	out	there	is	a	cold	.
but	if	that	's	the	case	,	there	should	be	some	kind	of	wear	pattern	from	a	shoe	.
i	thought	that	we	should	have	our	own	founder	's	day	party	.
we	were	four	hours	from	a	major	drug	bust	this	morning	.
carrie	,	honey	,	i	'm	into	something	really	huge	right	now	,	okay	?
i	know	the	things	you	say	when	i	'm	not	there
so	is	that	why	you	did	n't	show	up	for	dinner	last	night	?
falkenstein	castle	is	one	of	the	many	beautiful	places	to	have	a	fairy	tale	wedding	or	special	event	.
well	,	i	suppose	the	lady	ashley	droving	in	the	cattle	her	self	.
yeah	,	but	she	's	been	gone	all	summer	,	and	he	's	still	boo	rad	ley	.
you	know	what	,	i	do	n't	need	a	drink	.	or	a	car	,	or	a	job	.
because	we	are	gon	na	find	ourselves	a	five	carat	cartier	solitaire	.
how	close	could	we	be	to	such	as	him	,	hmm	?
from	a	little	over	three	years	ago	and	it	says
the	president	will	go	to	new	york	from	here	to	...
i	'm	on	days	.	we	could	go	back	to	writing	notes
i	thought	you	only	listened	to	norah	jones	?	no	,	i	'm	taking	reggae	ton	lessons	with	...	every	saturday	.
not	that	knocking	me	off	the	wagon	would	be	a	small	price	.
and	i	pray	that	you	open	your	heart	to	believe	it	,
yeah	.	so	do	n't	make	fun	of	the	ridiculous	amount	of	male	jewelry	that	he	's	wearing	.
i	'd	rather	look	at	nude	photos	of	her	original	body	.
i	have	tried	,	i	go	to	the	factory	every	morning	.
and	i	am	so	thrilled	to	know	that	you	still	love	me	,
we	have	included	a	microwave	,	refrigerator	,	coffee	maker	,	hairdryer	and	iron	.
oh	yeah	,	that	's	right	.	he	said	you	guys	are	cops	.
it	's	great	to	be	back	here	in	may	field	,	not	just	for	the	food	,
i	do	n't	care	so	long	as	she	finds	them	again	next	year
i	was	n't	...	i	was	n't	trying	to	hurt	myself	.	do	n't	worry	about	any	of	that	.
that	's	right	,	you	losers	.	you	take	one	step	and	you	're	dead	.
lifetime	(	for	the	expected	lifetime	of	the	product	-	minimally	ten	years	)	.
oh	,	it	's	ok	,	never	mind	.	i	'll	take	your	word	for	it	.
i	could	die	out	here	if	i	do	n't	get	a	fire	lit	.
do	you	still	think	that	i	do	n't	mean	what	i	say	?
that	he	is	a	headstrong	and	impulsive	young	man	.	but	you	probably	figured	that	out	for	yourself	.
you	remember	my	brother	,	the	one	who	lives	in	brazil	?
the	,	uh	,	scared	little	kitten	lets	the	big	gorilla	cuddle	it
i	've	seen	kim	sit	on	it	before	.	her	ass	ai	n't	your	ass	.
okay	,	whatever	you	had	to	do	,	you	did	in	self	-	defense	,	i	get	that	.
you	know	,	you	could	be	even	more	connected	,	if	you	wanted	.
we	're	going	home	.	i	do	n't	want	any	more	blood	on	my	hands	.
yes	,	your	honor	,	i	understand	you	think	it	's	a	bad	idea	.
do	you	know	how	to	figure	out	the	area	of	a	rectangle	?
why	should	i	waste	my	beautiful	mind	on	something	like	that	?
what	are	our	options	?	vis	-	a	-	vis	publicity	,	media	?
but	i	knew	the	white	swan	would	n't	be	a	problem	.
can	we	all	stop	being	so	fucking	polite	and	get	to	the	point	?
so	i	had	to	hit	all	the	sounds	here	instead	of	back	.
yeah	,	he	used	to	be	one	of	our	most	cutthroat	and	successful	brokers	.
i	'm	taking	away	your	puppet	.	because	i	want	you	to	think	about	what	you	did	.
if	we	knew	their	address	,	maybe	we	could	see	if	our	car	was	there	.
i	told	you	we	should	have	handled	this	shit	ourselves	.
getting	towed	out	to	the	scrap	belt	.	that	ai	n't	us	.
i	m	going	to	go	upstairs	and	run	a	hot	bath	,	right	?
i	broke	my	hip	a	few	months	ago	,	and	i	am	some	what	incapacitated	.
when	was	the	last	time	you	heard	of	a	drive	-	by	where	no	one	got	hit	?
he	's	in	jail	,	so	you	've	no	choice	but	to	disband	the	family	.
you	have	high	cholesterol	did	you	have	any	meat	?	answer	me	!
that	would	explain	why	we	found	both	rings	in	the	ashes	.
what	do	you	think	have	to	st	thing	you	go	through	was	?
well	,	he	said	no	.	he	says	we	have	no	proof	.
we	're	ahead	in	the	polls	,	if	that	's	what	you	're	referring	to	,	thom	.
now	,	come	on	,	sergeant	,	it	's	not	your	job	to	investigate	this	incident	,	is	it	?
only	two	wires	were	left	.	there	was	n't	any	more	time	.
thought	i	was	going	to	have	time	to	come	back	,
his	version	of	events	-	he	went	up	to	complain	about	something	,
they	prepared	a	dinner	for	him	there	which	martha	helped	serve	.
ok	,	what	the	hell	do	i	do	?	go	in	and	tell	them	the	truth	.
you	said	you	wanted	to	see	more	of	the	new	orleans	music	scene	.
you	already	left	one	white	boy	down	in	my	basement
yeah	,	we	kept	going	in	a	circle	which	is	what	i	said	.
to	what	do	i	owe	the	pleasure	of	your	visit	?
when	an	animal	gives	a	warning	that	danger	is	imminent	...
you	know	that	i	did	n't	have	sex	with	a	college	guy	,	right	?
look	,	whatever	you	got	going	on	here	,	this	is	n't	really	my	thing	.

i	'm	a	senior	vp	for	a	real	estate	development	company	.
what	did	we	do	?	what	did	he	do	?	what	'd	he	tell	you	?
i	thought	my	mother	knew	who	i	was	much	better	than	i	knew	myself	.
you	call	me	down	here	to	talk	face	to	face	about	my	husband	,
and	when	he	died	we	never	once	considered	turning	him	into	a	jacket	.
does	betsy	like	apples	like	my	little	monkey	loves	apples	?
a	young	lady	like	yourself	,	with	three	young	children	,	should	think	again	.

even	though	he	did	n't	want	to	give	the	lecture	in	the	first	place	,
you	probably	forgot	that	i	got	food	poisoning	on	that	frittata	.
then	,	the	next	thing	i	did	,	i	started	busting	out	high	-	stakes	poker	players	.
is	it	a	good	partnership	for	you	do	you	think	?
i	'm	just	trying	to	explain	what	this	experience	was	like	,	what	it	felt	like	.
gosh	,	it	's	just	like	old	times	.	i	'm	so	happy	you	two	are	friends	again	!
i	just	ca	n't	.	if	you	stay	here	you	are	fucked	.
my	life	what	i	have	left	of	it	-
and	all	of	his	descendants	as	numerous	as	the	stars	.
i	can	ascertain	that	he	was	shot	from	a	higher	angle	;
i	've	got	two	on	my	right	and	one	straight	dead	ahead	.
ever	had	any	,	or	is	it	also	something	you	aspire	to	?
why	are	you	angry	at	me	?	fine	!	you	do	n't	want	this	?
i	mean	he	was	supposed	to	die	in	that	explosion	,	but	he	did	n't	.
i	thought	this	was	supposed	to	be	anonymous	.	it	is	.
why	would	he	apologize	to	you	?	yeah	,	i	know	.	that	's	weird	.
oh	,	i	do	n't	want	to	interrupt	,	but	you	called	me	.	-	yes	.
of	course	,	i	picked	one	in	the	worst	part	of	town
many	years	ago	i	had	a	friend	,	a	dear	friend	.
i	just	go	over	them	in	my	mind	,	even	if	i	'm	not	doing	them	.
yes	,	of	course	.	if	they	come	back	,	you	may	show	them	in	.
it	's	no	questions	asked	.	that	is	the	rule	on	the	gun	buyback	program	.
i	should	have	known	you	'd	have	something	to	do	with	this	,	valentine	.
mom	,	it	's	not	his	fault	.	every	day	she	gets	rescheduled	for	some	emergency	.
but	i	do	.	-	i	do	n't	care	!	i	'm	getting	my	chest	waxed	!
talk	to	him	that	way	again	and	you	'll	find	out	.
gosh	,	now	i	can	see	why	evil	queens	are	so	evil	.
i	seem	to	recall	you	showing	me	pictures	of	such	,	sir	.
that	will	be	my	special	thank	you	for	all	of	your	hard	work	.
he	's	got	two	left	before	he	's	out	of	this	challenge	.
of	,	dude	,	i	ca	n't	wait	to	just	go	back	home	.
but	as	the	girls	got	older	and	began	their	female	mood	swings	.
i	mean	,	i	'm	gon	na	get	more	comfortable	with	the	patients	and	instruments	.
an	office	on	the	seventh	floor	.	an	office	on	the	seventh	floor	.
take	it	to	ron	's	.	he	watches	that	national	geographic	shit	.
the	backwash	into	this	glass	is	every	pathogen	that	calls	your	mouth	home	,	sweet	home	.
oh	,	we	can	take	it	from	here	.	thank	you	.	you	're	welcome	.
i	know	that	,	but	...	you	said	that	you	wanted	this	.
next	,	it	'll	be	the	bride	's	third	cousin	with	the	wonky	eye	.
for	the	next	six	hours	,	you	're	still	working	for	me	.
hi	.	i	'll	be	back	in	three	months	,	if	i	'm	not	eaten	by	piranhas	.
i	just	need	that	money	to	be	in	that	account	.
four	very	long	minutes	for	arsenal	,	four	very	short	ones	for	real	madrid	.
or	we	could	focus	-	on	the	number	one	.
we	were	fine	until	you	came	along	and	made	us	your	guinea	pigs	.
because	everyone	's	looking	for	their	own	angle	for	a	story	...
yeah	,	how	you	gon	na	handle	it	?	i	'm	gon	na	love	it	.
i	'm	sorry	.	i	did	n't	wanna	make	you	feel	uncomfortable	or	nothing	.	i	just	-
do	n't	you	think	i	'm	the	best	judge	of	when	i	'm	overextending	myself	?
i	know	you	all	got	a	lot	of	questions	,	but	listen	up	.
the	rest	of	us	just	point	and	click	but	not	without	caution	.
i	felt	the	same	way	on	the	day	i	married	your	mother	.
oh	,	what	the	hell	did	you	think	it	was	about	?
i	believe	to	do	anything	less	would	be	to	suggest
does	she	blame	me	for	losing	the	baby	?	of	course	not	.	give	her	time	.
sorry	for	enjoying	myself	on	vacation	.	you	should	try	it	sometime	.
bet	it	big	.	you	will	be	rich	if	the	number	strikes	.
thank	god	you	saved	us	.	keep	smiling	.	she	's	still	watching	.
have	you	met	him	as	well	?	dad	,	it	's	the	man	from	the	wedding	,
oh	,	boy	.	the	man	-	poet	who	banged	france	's	dark	lady	of	philosophy	.
at	ross	-	on	-	wye	follow	the	signs	towards	monmouth	,	then	take	the	a472	signposted	usk	.
so	i	wanted	to	say	happy	anniversary	and	cheer	you	on	in	person	.
aluminum	plate	graphics	-surface	painted	to	match	pms	411c	-typeface	:
oh	,	i	'm	sorry	.	i	did	n't	realize	we	were	getting	drunk	first	thing	in	the	morning	.
the	closer	i	get	to	the	truth	,	the	louder	the	whispered	voices	around	me	,
she	said	the	same	thing	when	we	visited	washington	,	dc	.
i	'm	doing	this	under	protest	.	the	per	could	still	be	in	there	!
if	it	bothers	you	i	can	put	my	art	out	.
i	do	n't	know	what	came	over	me	,	i	am	really	sorry	.
and	you	think	they	're	just	gon	na	talk	to	you	because	you	have	the	tattoo	now	?
yeah	,	i	can	see	that	.	i	'm	already	in	.
is	n't	that	so	,	father	?	-	he	keep	the	rhythm	going	.
for	they	are	all	connected	to	water	filled	vessels	that	run	through	the	body	.
but	until	you	get	on	track	i	do	n't	want	you	down	there	.
i	'm	going	to	have	to	tell	them	you	know	that	.
make	a	left	and	the	best	westert	the	inn	at	rochester	airport	will	be	on	your	immediate	left	.
and	just	the	experience	of	being	out	in	the	mountains	.
but	the	gleam	was	meant	to	inspire	you	to	the	mountain	heights	where	i	now	wait	.
you	've	got	a	lot	of	growing	up	to	do	,	buddy	.
but	let	me	show	you	a	trick	.	consider	the	earth	's	orbit	around	the	sun	.
i	mean	,	if	he	wants	me	that	badly	,	that	just	gives	me	leverage	to	get	what	i	want	.
but	i	did	n't	know	if	you	like	sweet	or	salty	,	so	i	got	you	pretzels	and	.
for	example	,	if	you	choose	to	drive	down	a	certain	street	...
me	and	my	dad	often	talk	about	it	at	home	.
do	you	want	this	back	or	not	?	i	have	a	double	.
he	's	just	...	it	's	not	good	.	i	do	n't	want	you	to	catch	it	.
do	n't	get	rid	of	anything	unless	you	are	absolutely	certain	that	that	's	what	you	wanna	do	.
we	'll	get	to	know	each	other	better	,	i	hope	?	-	okay	.	yeah	.	for	sure	.
he	's	just	saying	what	he	knows	you	need	to	hear	.
everyone	not	in	the	family	is	disposable	to	them	,	after	all	,
who	could	ever	love	a	beast	so	hideous	and	ugly	?
i	already	have	the	judas	plate	and	the	judas	knife	and	fork	.
what	if	someone	says	"	bridget	jones	,	get	out	of	here	,	you	are	ridiculous	"	?
he	chose	when	that	girl	lived	and	he	chose	when	that	girl	died	.
without	a	shining	and	moving	voice	,	i	am	full	of	sincerity	.
so	what	we	need	to	find	next	is	a	story	that	develops	-
george	company	has	a	squad	sitting	right	in	that	area	.
i	know	what	it	means	.	i	played	varsity	forward	at	stanford	.
my	parents	did	n't	even	bother	to	drop	me	off	at	a	hospital	.
and	it	thought	that	that	was	all	to	life	there	was	.
make	a	reservation	today	at	the	best	western	plus	hotel	horizon	.
and	she	's	smack	in	the	middle	of	the	leopard	's	path	.

you	know	,	victoria	,	marshall	and	i	did	long	distance	once	.
you	do	not	apologize	.	now	it	's	my	job	to	take	care	of	you	,	okay	?
over	the	past	decade	,	a	majority	of	black	-	market	dealers	stopped	trading	in	cash	.
from	a	collapsible	toothbrush	to	a	pair	of	ordinary	black	socks	.
if	he	wants	me	to	offer	you	the	job	something	's	going	on	.
have	you	heard	from	my	dad	in	the	last	24	hours	?
but	you	were	a	baby	in	these	rooms	.	you	came	from	here	.
how	do	you	feel	about	red	and	green	chili	in	every	other	thing	you	're	gon	na	eat	?
but	i	felt	our	last	interaction	ended	too	abruptly	.	may	i	sit	?
and	give	himself	up	,	i	'm	afraid	i	'm	gon	na	have	to	back	burner	it	.
they	had	an	affair	while	i	was	recuperating	from	the	stroke	.
i	told	him	you	were	fine	.	i	also	told	him	we	needed	an	offer	immediately	.
and	you	did	n't	have	anything	to	do	with	what	happened	in	new	york	...
i	'm	sorry	.	i	'm	just	gon	na	go	sleep	it	off	or	something	.
read	me	this	letter	from	my	son	.	he	works	far	away	.
every	aspect	of	our	lives	has	been	touched	by	this	digital	revolution	.
it	's	disgusting	.	and	the	way	he	bribes	her	for	sex
we	see	the	culture	that	goes	back	for	hundreds	of	years	.
you	've	become	the	family	planning	pilot	village	just	3	months	ago	,
did	n't	you	arrest	the	guy	who	killed	him	?	turns	out	,	he	was	coerced	.
you	will	be	prompt	and	you	will	work	late	when	i	require	.
these	non	-	smoking	rooms	feature	one	king	bed	,	a	river	view	,	rain	shower	head	,	sofa	bed	and	high	-	speed	internet	access	.
but	it	's	gon	na	take	your	visit	to	get	him	to	agree	.
see	,	a	lot	of	artists	are	they	're	troubled	,	temperamental	.
if	you	're	gon	na	do	this	,	ellis	,	you	better	do	it	now	.
if	this	man	is	sick	,	he	's	now	mine	,	do	you	understand	?
for	killing	a	man	!	i	mean	,	where	would	he	have	been	without	me	?
my	mother	has	cancer	...	i	am	the	only	one	that	can	work	.
well	,	yeah	.	listen	,	i	was	judging	her	the	way	i	saw	the	vocals	.	right	?
you	want	it	to	go	better	than	today	,	you	need	to	get	some	rest	.
i	do	n't	want	you	riling	him	all	up	about	coming	back	.
and	she	came	into	my	room	with	a	whole	bushel	basket	full	of	tomatoes	.
nothing	's	changed	at	all	.	i	have	to	go	back	to	my	meeting	.
i	gave	up	spain	to	come	back	here	to	look	for	my	sister	,
make	it	,	make	it	,	make	it	.
give	this	willfully	minimal	answer	that	just	requires	another	question	.
but	it	's	not	there	,	we	're	not	there	yet	,	we	're	almost	double	-	we	're	way	above	that	now	.
mm	-	hmm	,	yeah	,	i	'm	going	nail	yo	'	ass	!	i	'm	going	nail	yo	'	ass	!
i	'm	on	my	way	.	we	'll	have	to	continue	this	later	.
have	i	not	made	camelot	a	fairer	and	more	just	kingdom	?
but	think	of	a	good	book	,	one	of	your	favorite	books
the	concept	of	a	plurality	of	worlds	was	a	very	widely	accepted	concept	in	the
if	someone	offered	me	something	with	so	much	of	love	...
do	we	know	where	this	order	came	from	?	yes	,	we	do	,	sir	.	roger	stanton	.
i	'm	just	saying	,	the	guy	's	a	judge	.	he	can	put	a	shirt	on	.
yeah	,	i	've	told	you	,	it	's	creepy	when	you	say	that	.
i	help	you	once	can	you	help	me	in	return	?
yeah	,	do	n't	forget	all	the	dead	buffers	in	the	freezer	,
you	may	not	be	able	to	see	it	,	folks	,	but	the	gauntlet	just	landed	on	my	desk	.
do	you	realize	i	have	n't	bought	a	new	outfit	in	five	years	?
we	know	that	we	gave	it	all	we	had	and	that	's	the	most	important	thing	,
why	do	n't	you	get	a	search	warrant	,	sheriff	,	and	see	for	yourself	?
that	's	why	we	need	to	find	the	6	crystals	and	bring	them	together	.
but	it	's	out	and	away	from	the	hospital	.	-	so	how	do	we	get	to	it	?
me	in	there	,	him	down	here	,	both	of	us	bawling	our	eyes	out	.
the	only	possibilities	are	some	other	folks	found	the	money	and
because	she	'll	want	to	steal	your	investor	for	a	donation	.
as	you	know	,	it	's	ironclad	.	we	tried	to	reach	freddy	bender	.
if	i	read	this	right	,	sir	,	we	have	full	power	.
a	system	that	calls	for	12	people	to	sit	and	listen	to	testimony	of	witnesses	,	fella	!
solid	stream	,	minus	four	days	,	six	hours	,	three	minutes	,	45	seconds	,
to	see	what	you	're	up	against	.	i	can	see	.	why	come	out	?
what	are	you	doing	?	i	just	said	i	ca	n't	come	.
tonight	we	are	here	to	present	the	nominee	for	best	comedic	performance	.
oh	,	yes	.	i	better	get	a	hold	of	the	captain	of	the	dockyards	.
it	is	non	-	smoking	and	comes	with	an	excellent	queen	bed	that	you	can	relax	at	night	on	.
yeah	,	we	're	separated	,	and	he	still	wants	me	to	call	his	mother	for	her	birthday	?
i	do	n't	want	to	...	i	do	n't	want	to	cause	a	problem	.
sa	-	yong	,	nobody	will	blame	you	if	we	lose	.
so	we	just	have	to	chop	up	the	body	,	and	we	put	the	limbs	in	little	plastic	baggies
i	know	my	characters	are	so	believable	that	they	seem	to	leap	off	the	page	.
because	we	're	too	deafened	by	the	din	of	our	bodies	to	hear	god	's	word	.
forget	the	sheriff	,	forget	the	soldiers	.	just	you	and	me	.
well	,	the	world	court	is	here	,	and	the	city	has	always	been	an	international	center	,
tell	him	that	the	devil	's	putting	a	hit	on	him	?
i	mean	,	it	'd	be	a	shame	if	you	did	n't	graduate	...
she	gives	the	worst	gifts	.	not	if	she	ca	n't	find	the	baby	.
if	he	had	wanted	to	,	he	would	've	already	done	it	.
you	're	about	to	be	the	last	eligible	man	in	new	york	.
so	i	took	you	out	onto	the	lake	so	we	could	be	alone	.
why	do	n't	they	just	make	the	whole	plane	out	of	the	black	box	?
i	am	a	recovering	drug	addict	.	so	it	's	a	date	.
manna	from	heaven	,	and	yet	i	have	n't	heard	a	whisper	from	the	white	house	confirming	the	affair	.
do	n't	get	me	all	emotional	before	i	go	on	stage	.
oh	,	yeah	,	of	course	they	did	.	why	would	n't	they	have	?
come	on	,	guys	,	i	ca	n't	forget	you	.	you	're	my	cheer	sisters	.
but	there	is	no	way	this	guy	is	getting	away	from	me	now	.
flag	everywhere	in	this	world	.	i	spent	a	year	in	germany	and
i	could	take	you	to	school	,	honey	,	if	you	're	feeling	better	now	.
and	i	'm	sure	that	the	police	are	doing	everything	they	can	.
i	mean	,	you	compromised	the	quality	of	my	education	because	of	my	color	.
oh	,	he	was	looking	for	money.he	seemed	pretty	desperate	,	though	.
i	made	the	decisions	i	believed	in	my	heart	to	be	right	.
tonight	,	they	'll	take	that	anger	to	the	board	of	supervisors
if	i	did	n't	know	any	better	,	i	'd	say	you	were	trying	to	hide	me	.
if	you	wanted	beauty	tips	,	all	you	had	to	do	was	ask	.
and	the	reason	i	say	not	really	is	because	six	dancers	have	to
closer	to	home	,	there	are	a	few	dozen	stars
let	's	just	say	it	's	a	good	thing	that	he	has	n't	been	in	touch	.
come	on	,	florence	,	you	know	that	lying	is	not	in	my	nature	.
god	,	i	love	kissing	you	in	a	stolen	government	vehicle	,
you	know	,	there	was	a	lot	of	crazy	going	on
would	you	care	to	make	a	small	wager	on	that	?
i	mean	,	when	am	i	gon	na	get	a	chance	like	that	again	?
you	're	both	on	parole	and	i	just	waxed	the	floor	.
what	would	you	do	if	you	were	n't	out	making	yourself	a	better	citizen	?
this	bugs	the	hell	out	of	me	.	i	'm	worried	too	!
i	begged	her	to	just	open	her	eyes	one	more	time	.
has	brought	you	at	last	to	the	bottom	of	a	whisky	bottle
but	you	,	you	're	going	for	the	rest	of	your	life	.
and	my	hope	that	he	will	make	a	speedy	recovery	.
we	're	located	near	sinclair	with	easy	access	to	the	town	and	the	top	destinations	in	that	region	.
his	guys	came	to	my	house	.	they	tried	to	shoot	me	in	the	street	.
i	do	n't	care	how	sick	your	spouse	gets	,	you	do	n't	jump	ship	.
he	lead	me	in	the	paths	of	righteousness	for	his	namesake	.
are	you	asking	because	you	're	interested	in	my	well	-	being	,
can	i	think	about	it	?	five	,	four	,	three	,	two	,	now	.
i	will	sit	at	your	feet	,	and	i	will	serve	you	for	all	of	eternity	.
you	wanted	to	bse	!	like	i	was	something	you	could	just	toss	on	the	table	!
and	then	how	long	after	that	until	it	gets	to	los	angeles	?
i	try	and	i	try	,	but	all	i	want	to	do
so	,	my	mom	found	the	dogs	playing	with	something	unusual	this	morning	.
so	either	i	get	behind	your	idea	or	we	sell	the	juice	at	a	loss	.
mona	:	maybe	,	we	should	all	go	to	the	lounge	and	calm	down	.
i	got	from	a	worthless	part	-	time	instructor	like	you	.
you	know	i	do	n't	think	they	've	even	painted	this	room	since	then	.
you	know	i	thought	with	the	tomato	it	would	sharpen	it	a	bit	-
but	secretly	we	think	we	're	just	one	spin	of	the	wheel	.
i	am	bringing	my	consulting	business	here	because	i	think	it	's	a	good	fit	,
i	did	n't	ask	when	's	the	last	time	she	mentioned	it	.
right	.	my	mother	is	flying	the	kids	up	at	4:00
even	though	i	do	n't	admire	him	,	and	to	try	to	give	you	a	sense
i	know	.	me	too	.	i	'll	believe	it	when	i	see	it	.
long	enough	to	hurt	the	people	who	still	give	a	damn	.
it	's	because	she	's	your	sister	and	you	have	a	chance	to	help	her	.
i	know	,	buddy	.	you	might	have	to	try	a	slip	move	.
he	most	likely	has	tunnel	vision	and	believes	that	she	holds	the	key	to	his	happiness	.
actually	he	's	engaged	to	someone	he	met	in	new	york	.
someplace	warm	where	you	could	relax	,	take	your	mind	off	the	museum	.
like	this	cup	,	you	are	full	of	opinions	and	speculations	.
yeah	,	a	diluted	solution	of	perchloric	acid	exposed	to	u.	v.	light	will	induce	fluorescence	.
we	know	she	hit	her	head	.	i	had	a	good	look	but	there	's	nothing	on	the	skull	.
look	up	where	the	gate	is	supposed	to	close	.	see	a	doohickey	?
so	i	need	to	win	it	soon	if	i	'm	going	to	win	it	.
you	're	actually	ingesting	potentially	deadly	bacteria	from	about	39	soil	-	handed	strangers	.
that	he	never	made	the	hole	in	one	.	-	okay	.
you	know	,	family	crap	...	home	towns	,	college	stories	,	old	girlfriends	,	old	guy	stuff	.
i	can	see	no	detailed	evidence	which	would	allow	me	to	hold	the	defendant	liable	.
you	do	n't	really	belong	to	them	.	stay	where	you	are	.
if	they	're	smart	enough	to	cover	up	the	bullet	hole	with	plaster	,
three	or	four	cars	for	the	whole	half	hour	i	was	down	there	?
i	compared	pebbles	from	the	crime	scene	to	the	pebbles	from	dan	noble	's	doormat	.
pat	,	what	's	this	i	hear	about	you	just	getting	out	?
and	i	'm	like	put	this	woman	in	a	home	already	!
quick	,	quick	,	come	!	you	'll	never	believe	what	i	've	just	found	.
4.00	mile(s	)	from	alba	's	,	full	service	,	international	,	open	for	:	lunch	,	dinner	.
go	find	billy	.	see	if	you	can	sober	him	up	.
ladies	and	gentlemen	,	ladies	and	gentlemen	.	we	are	interrupting	our	regular	broadcast
water	slides	for	both	the	very	young	and	brave	children	.
hypoperfusion	,	the	fetus	is	basically	a	parasite	stealing	nutrients	,	minerals	,	blood	.
but	having	a	baby	's	gon	na	make	that	a	real	challenge	.
it	's	a	nice	story	.	it	's	about	a	dog	in	alaska	.
well	,	i	'm	just	saying	what	's	wrong	with	changing	things	up	a	little	bit	?
i	know	that	's	not	what	you	want	for	these	people	.
is	it	my	fault	?	i	mean	,	i	've	had	a	lot	on	my	mind	and	...
cause	i	want	to	help	you	.	you	want	to	help	now	.
you	start	at	the	bottom	and	you	work	your	way	up	to	the	top	.
and	understand	that	if	an	attempt	is	made	on	his	life	,
oh	,	do	we	need	to	explore	anger	management	in	our	next	session	?
and	she	does	n't	look	like	she	has	any	intentions	of	backing	down	.
sometimes	i	imagine	that	i	go	through	it	and	fly	,	like	you	,	over	barcelona	.
i	've	taken	the	liberty	of	drafting	these	work	flow	charts	which	outline	our	various	duties
cable	satellite	television	with	over	70	channels	and	hbo	?	cnn	?	or	other	24	-	hour	news	station
of	course	.	i	just	thought	he	could	cheer	you	up	a	little	,	that	's	all	.
something	tells	me	it	's	the	last	place	i	'll	want	to	go	.
my	sweet	,	beautiful	child	who	i	have	n't	seen	in	a	week	.
the	nerve	gas	will	most	likely	be	released	into	a	ventilation	unit	.
he	wants	to	know	who	's	gon	na	be	there	.	i	'll	call	him	.
let	's	get	'em	out	of	here	and	get	'	em	on	the	chopper	!
you	'll	have	real	access	to	hitler	,	his	advisers	,	his	schedule	.	we	need	this	.
but	to	go	into	people	's	lives	,	the	details	,	l	mean	.
got	the	pair	of	eyeballs	,	ca	n't	help	but	use	'em	.
but	if	she	thinks	i	'd	consider	it	,	it	also	means	she	'd	consider	it	for	me	.
look	i	told	this	all	to	the	cops	back	then	.
i	do	n't	seem	to	be	able	to	find	your	sister	.
she	said	that	since	you	get	to	keep	the	one	bedroom	apartment	you	should	give	rachel	the	purple	chair	?
just	because	you	have	n't	seen	it	does	n't	mean	it	does	n't	exist	.
hi	.	mark	cohen	here	for	buzz	line	.	back	to	you	,	alexi	.
if	it	was	n't	so	late	i	would	invite	you	up	for	coffee	.
you	only	think	i	guessed	wrong	.	that	's	what	's	so	funny	!
you	did	n't	see	him	doing	his	little	pee	pee	dance	?
because	you	liked	their	second	one	,	you	said	.	um	,	pop	girls	,	etc	.
i	can	handle	this	fresh	prince	stuff	if	you	wanna	take	a	couple	of	days	...
so	they	begin	taping	as	soon	as	they	sense	any	movement	,
if	we	all	painted	our	faces	like	clowns	all	the	time	,
but	when	i	cleaned	that	covered	.	i	found	a	bunch	of	money	.
but	jacob	wood	and	all	the	other	gun	violence	victims
we	're	supposed	to	break	ground	in	less	than	20	hours	.	we	're	under	imminent	threat	.
you	put	a	round	in	a	man	's	head	in	front	of	all	those	people
mm	-	hmm	.	in	other	words	,	why	not	stop	there	?
i	bet	i	must	've	used	every	pen	in	that	whole	house	.
so	you	did	n't	think	that	anybody	would	end	up	dead	because	of	this	list	?
we	went	to	bed	a	little	after	9:00	,	and	,	um	,	ever	since	the	baby	arrived	,
however	i	thought	the	song	and	the	lyrics	was	absolutely	horrible	.
and	i	declare	the	science	you	are	doing	is	too	shocking	by	half	.
public	and	professional	consensus	is	the	acoustics	in	the	hall	are	outstanding	.
is	it	possible	to	buy	a	ticket	to	paris	?	leaving	tomorrow	.
after	the	cold	war	they	stopped	making	these	nuclear	missile	guidance	system	kits
he	had	nothing	to	do	with	the	crime	scene	evidence	.
you	go	in	charm	them	drop	a	few	hands	,	then	you	kill	them	.
well	,	i	saw	it	on	"	the	i	word	.	"	i	assume	they	have	consultants	.
colonel	,	i	'm	detecting	a	massive	build	-	up	of	energy	from	the	planet	!
you	know	,	i	keep	my	money	buried	in	my	potato	field	.
you	're	driving	me	crazy	.	and	i	have	to	tell	you	the	truth	.
all	right	.	you	guys	are	really	frustrated	tonight	,	are	n't	you	?
i	'm	telling	you	,	they	just	melt	over	country	music	lyrics	,	man	,
that	's	it	!	no	more	cookie	breaks	for	anybody	!	do	you	people	want	to	be	here	all	night	!
you	like	that	,	old	man	?	you	want	a	piece	of	me	?
yes	,	i	do	,	and	i	'd	be	asking	the	exact	same	question	if	i	were	in	your	shoes	.
i	can	make	that	change	.	i	've	got	it	.	i	've	got	it	on	both	copies	.
and	your	brother	-	in	-	law	trying	to	throw	a	net	over	the	whole	deal	,
if	there	is	something	going	around	you	might	have	been	exposed	to	it	as	well	.
okay	,	i	wo	n't	tell	you	.	we	just	received	this	from	the	mayor	.
if	temperature	goes	into	red	zone	,	there	is	nuclear	chain	-	reaction	inside	the	core	.
if	this	does	come	to	combat	,	we	will	not	be	in	the	battle	for	the	sake	of	the	battle	.
i	call	it	a	gift	.	for	them	it	was	more	like	a	cosmic	joke	.
and	that	,	earl	is	why	i	got	all	five	of	these	gift	bags	for	you	.
hey	,	pal	,	uh	,	how	many	of	those	have	i	had	?
the	light	from	that	was	emitted	when	the	universe	was	700	to	800	million	years	old	.
i	mean	,	do	you	really	want	to	be	known	as	the	guy	who	writes
you	have	one	choice	.	open	the	lock	,	or	she	's	gon	na	die	.
and	dragged	you	off	the	beach	,	but	i	had	to	do	something	.
i	am	really	not	in	the	market	for	an	explanation	now	,	cate	.
but	the	day	will	never	come	that	we	forsake	this	planet
i	feel	-	i	-	no	,	i	'm	not	going	to	kill	him	.
i	have	kate	warner	for	you	.	should	i	put	her	through	?
you	see	.	you	do	n't	just	dash	off	a	book	full	of	sharply	observed	.	hilarious	...
she	feels	the	community	might	be	better	served	without	this	trial	.
in	a	dress	that	i	made	myself	.	and	this	year	...
i	know	.	daddy	said	it	was	the	most	fun	ever	.
you	know	that	i	've	never	had	anybody	be	so	generous	to	me	.
the	nearby	hampton	coliseum	always	has	something	fun	happening	,	and	is	an	excellent	choice	for	a	little	recreational	fun	.
and	the	way	you	process	this	emotionally	is	by	going	undercover	with	the	mob	.
i	'm	okay	with	him	being	there	and	me	being	here	.
can	i	buyout	a	cup	of	coffee	?	comfort	of	strangers	and	all	that	?
you	want	some	coffee	,	or	something	to	eat	?	-	nah	,	i	'm	good	.
flying	a	transport	plane	if	i	'm	one	of	the	lucky	ones	?
you	trying	to	do	,	scare	me	?	you	said	there	would	n't	be	any	screw	-	ups	.
my	mom	and	i	talked	,	she	wo	n't	let	me	see	you	outside	of	school	for	awhile	.
in	return	we	must	invade	polynesia	on	behalf	of	peru	?
if	i	got	to	introduce	you	to	everyone	in	this	goddamn	place	as	denise	waverly	,

i	care	,	dad	.	this	has	been	bothering	me	for	a	while	.
i	just	went	out	!	god	,	i	did	n't	even	-	i	did	n't	drink	,	i	did	n't	get	high	!

he	'll	be	gone	in	two	days	.	i	have	an	idea	who	might	replace	him	.
you	want	to	shut	me	out	,	that	's	fine	.	that	's	fine	.
i	do	n't	need	that	.	i	need	that	.	get	out	of	here	!

dude	,	what	are	all	these	homeless	people	doing	in	front	of	your	house	?
i	thought	this	was	only	supposed	to	happen	in	the	morning	.

there	's	only	one	person	in	the	world	that	would	call	me	at	2	o'clock	in	the	morning
he	's	gone	back	to	the	original	dig	site	to	find	more	bones	.
so	i	'm	partly	responsible	for	what	you	're	going	through	right	now	.
honey	,	i	am	so	sorry	about	this	.	look	it	,	just	hang	in	there	.
if	you	were	really	great	and	powerful	,	you	'd	keep	your	promises	.
we	can	all	go	out	together	.	no	.	this	is	a	date	.
so	i	figured	,	if	i	found	a	few	lapses	in	the	security	,
i	know	i	said	the	rain	-	dancing	thing	,	but	...	feel	no	pain	.
so	,	does	your	family	do	the	whole	traditional	family	christmas	?

i	do	n't	know	how	she	does	it	,	but	she	does	it	.
uh	,	i	just	said	it	'cause	i	wanted	everyone	to	listen	to	me	.
so	when	you	make	a	move	,	make	sure	it	's	the	right	one	.
so	do	i	need	to	worry	about	something	big	falling	on	you

i	ran	them	through	the	records	of	everyone	in	town	,	and	there	was	a	match	.
what	do	you	want	me	to	say	give	up	hope	?
one	of	the	best	things	that	happened	to	me	here	,
one	of	the	monks	sealed	it	inside	the	winding	wall	for	safekeeping	.
yeah	,	we	talked	to	those	people	off	the	list	that	you	gave	us	,

as	long	as	i	've	been	working	this	,	i	ai	n't	never	been	more	sure	of	anything	.
in	the	morning	,	the	breakfast	includes	fresh	fruit	,	hot	food	,	hot	waffles	,	juice	,	tea	,	100	%	arabica	coffee	and	pastries	.
you	realize	one	of	these	women	could	be	katie	's	killer	.
i	like	a	man	who	wants	to	be	in	charge	of	things	.
what	?	well	,	if	i	knew	that	,	it	would	n't	be	missing	.
i	gave	you	empirical	proof	that	i	did	not	prank	you	.
but	you	know	what	did	bounce	?	my	but	thole	through	my	face	.
audrey	raines	had	mentioned	to	me	that	you	were	helping	her	earlier	with	some	files	.
you	're	going	to	the	secretary	's	salon	tonight	,	right	?	yes	,	i	am	.

and	i	loved	that	you	took	a	chance	with	that	song	.
now	what	i	'm	thinking	is	that	someone	was	after	him	.
there	are	countless	big	rivets	just	bolting	every	little	component	in	place	.
keep	thinking	one	of	them	is	going	to	jump	out

while	the	others	were	raping	him	with	a	baseball	bat	.
a	ds	and	a	dc	in	the	organized	crime	unit	.
i	did	n't	even	make	it	back	with	the	data	cube	.
are	you	going	to	ask	questions	like	that	if	your	daughter	was	in	the	same	situation	?
but	i	think	we	should	wait	until	we	get	all	the	facts	.
if	this	is	gon	na	be	permanent	,	better	start	getting	used	to	it	.

the	shooter	would	've	had	to	aim	downward	to	impact	the	asphalt	.
it	's	only	a	matter	of	time	.	you	come	clean	with	us	,
why	do	n't	you	take	your	pal	strabo	with	you	.	remember	him	?
pour	milk	on	those	suck	as	and	just	lay	it	in	,	and	you	do	n't	wanna	eat	shit	.
why	?	are	you	and	your	partner	getting	paid	off	at	4:59	?
what	the	hell	were	you	doing	in	a	church	today	?
you	did	n't	throw	our	child	out	in	the	rain	.
you	can	use	the	computer	right	here	in	the	kitchen	tonight
but	that	's	never	gon	na	happen	so	long	as	you	hate	me	.
for	a	long	time	,	this	place	and	those	guys	have	been	my	whole	world	.
and	if	i	'm	wanted	for	attempted	murder	then	it	will	be	a	long	holiday	.
i	got	so	many	,	i	've	been	driving	around	all	night	returning	them	.

she	's	exploding	.	do	you	want	her	to	become	pregnant	with	some	dick	?
yes	,	i	'll	have	another	go	.	your	luck	's	got	to	run	out	sometime	.
if	you	do	not	come	to	a	complete	stop	,	we	could	miss	part	of	the	matter	stream	.
all	right	,	who	are	you	,	and	why	was	he	trying	to	shoot	you	?
so	i	said	,	why	ca	n't	people	bring	their	own	glasses	to	the	bar	?

why	are	you	hiding	here	?	they	are	coming	after	us
animal	,	human	and	the	like	-	that	are	located	in	them	,
so	you	stole	my	joke	and	you	stole	my	money	?
just	wanted	to	say	good	-	bye	to	you	and	dad	before	i	left	.
um	,	i	do	n't	know	.	maybe	like	4	or	5	miles	.
and	as	soon	as	i	got	fat	,	he	had	an	excuse	to	jump	into	any	bed	he	wanted	.

hey	,	pop	.	i	told	you	not	to	bring	anyone	here	.
if	we	're	out	buying	tampons	we	'll	miss	the	trailer	anyway	!
if	that	is	n't	enough	,	consider	that	if	you	make	this	a	war	,
i	've	given	you	guys	so	many	chances	to	just	be	honest	with	me	.
i	happen	to	come	from	a	long	line	of	exterminators	.

she	always	talked	about	how	she	wanted	to	find	you	when	you	were	18	.
i	went	to	get	my	gun	and	call	the	police	.
i	ai	n't	never	had	one	of	them	jump	at	me	,
but	she	shot	the	wrong	man	,	and	then	she	lied	about	it	.
i	might	add	that	there	will	probably	be	a	promotion	in	this
do	n't	put	your	hand	under	there	!	joe	,	you	do	n't	know	what	's	under	there	!
well	,	you	helped	turn	this	city	around	.	people	have	n't	forgotten	.

but	you	go	kicking	and	screaming	,	and	no	one	-
i	'm	gon	na	put	you	out	on	the	street	in	that	dog	suit	.
i	just	wish	that	you	were	here	to	go	with	me	.
it	's	early	,	you	know	i	only	got	out	with	her	for	couple	of	times	.
losing	your	mind	is	not	a	luxury	for	the	middle	class	.
oh	,	no	.	i	'm	confused	about	how	to	get	into	your	pants	.

oh	,	i	have	a	wedding	that	day	.	on	a	wednesday	?
i	did	not	notice	if	my	wife	was	in	bed	.
i	just	did	n't	expect	the	storm	would	last	as	long	as	it	has	.

your	cousin	was	my	counselor	inside	.	said	you	hired	guys	like	me	.
uh	...	so	,	anyway	,	this	was	a	music	industry	party	last	night	?
told	him	i	had	two	vics	and	a	serial	rapist	on	my	hands	.
i	watched	my	father	doing	exactly	what	society	told	him	to	.
merge	onto	u.s	.	hwy	2	east	.	take	a	left	at	third	set	of	traffic	lights	.
that	if	you	found	out	how	much	older	i	really	was	,
well	,	maybe	not	,	but	at	least	a	life	will	have	been	saved	.
okay	,	now	,	olive	fronds	aside	,	which	is	where	i	think	they	belong	...
she	'd	say	,	you	're	the	cat	's	meow	and	we	wow	the	crowd	again	.
if	i	file	for	an	extension	now	,	i	wo	n't	be	cutting	ribbon	in	11	months	.
he	shot	someone	,	he	's	on	the	run	,	he	's	under	extreme	duress	.
i	'm	saying	that	the	right	man	is	out	there	.	if	you	do	n't	grab	him	,	someone	else	will	,
if	it	's	in	the	file	,	i	do	n't	know	how	you	argue	with	that	.	you	do	n't	understand	.
who	was	determined	to	show	that	that	old	man	was	n't	really	as	smart
we	do	n't	need	the	feds	coming	in	now	to	muck	things	up	.
two	new	moms	.	i	'm	sure	you	've	got	a	lot	to	talk	about	.
but	does	n't	it	ever	feel	like	sometimes	it	's	just	too	much	?
he	rings	his	mother	,	she	misses	him	and	has	a	bad	back	.
think	of	what	would	have	become	of	my	life	if	i	had	not	met	you	？
come	on	,	marissa	's	the	best	thing	that	's	ever	happened	to	me	.
the	only	people	who	'll	be	at	this	takedown	are	our	people	.
why	do	n't	you	tell	me	you	actually	begin	to	give	a	damn	,	homie	!
he	that	would	vouch	it	in	any	place	but	here	.
sometimes	you	have	to	sacrifice	a	piece	to	win	an	adage	.
the	million	babies	mamas	march	?	it	's	a	very	good	cause	.
a	lot	of	folks	did	call	him	two	-	gun	,	but	not	because	he	had	two	pistols	.
i	know	how	hard	it	must	be	to	be	here	all	alone
you	're	skilled	at	getting	people	to	open	up	to	you	,	to	trust	you	.
if	you	want	to	make	an	example	of	me	,
i	kind	of	just	thought	the	bieber	thing	would	add	the	necessary	pop	at	the	end	.
so	,	basically	,	if	i	was	gon	na	go	out	with	you	,	i	would	be	making	the	conscious	choice	.
i	had	so	little	time	for	them	,	with	the	bar	and	all	...
my	post	-	op	and	pre	-	op	patients	are	backed	up	for	days	.
i	'm	settling	here	,	but	you	can	prevent	me	again	if	you	like	.
i	do	n't	have	to	sit	here	and	listen	to	this	!
i	...	i	'm	going	to	be	late	,	so	i	better	get	going	,
i	took	half	the	jaw	off	of	her	there	with	the	hurl	.
based	on	what	-	an	argument	with	the	mayor	's	aide	?
as	long	as	you	get	your	two	shots	of	limelight	every	day	.
complimentary	continental	breakfast	buffet	served	daily	from	7	am	to	10	am	in	the	riverside	room	.
during	his	days	,	it	became	the	seat	of	political	power	and	achieved	tremendous	importance	.
are	you	aware	that	ballistics	has	confirmed	that	the	perp	was	killed	-
karen	,	do	you	mind	if	we	start	this	conversation	tomorrow	?
yeah	,	but	not	if	they	're	attached	to	those	guidance	systems	,	right	?
and	if	the	girls	see	you	up	here	,	they	're	gon	na	take	it
last	week	,	motel	where	i	work	in	cut	my	hours	.
and	obviously	the	job	number	on	friday	was	n't	a	bad	number
late	check	out	,	available	on	request	for	a	nominal	fee
i	wonder	...	if	he	'll	ever	come	back	and	visit	us	.
oh	,	and	i	banged	the	bumper	trying	to	parallel	park	.
and	to	be	honest	,	even	to	the	reasonably	tutored	eye	,
who	was	trying	to	get	back	to	his	pregnant	wife	,
the	p.m.	would	have	my	head	if	he	knew	you	were	investigating	him	.
i	'm	all	for	it	.	just	know	if	you	do	it	,
if	it	does	,	i	see	you	locked	up	in	your	thoughts	,
he	's	not	on	the	team	.	he	's	not	even	a	student	.	been	here	for	three	days	.
and	i	guess	somewhere	along	the	way	,	i	lost	direction	myself	.
my	god	,	i	love	those	.	put	any	syrups	you	want	on	them	.
to	get	anything	done	in	new	york	city	,	you	had	to	.
if	it	is	courage	that	you	gave	me	the	live	going	to	down	that	i	say
i	work	as	a	night	watchman	on	sixth	avenue	in	new	york	city
just	take	a	look	around	and	you	notice	anything	missing	or	out	of	place	?
file	papers	at	the	office	for	refugees	.	sir	,	i	have	filed	papers	with	the	office	.
yeah	.	well	,	anyways	,	since	that	movie	about	the	life	of	the	band
and	also	where	i	met	an	old	friend	of	yours	,	monk	gyatso	.
do	n't	do	anything	rash	.	and	i	use	that	term	loosely	.
no	single	fret	on	the	street	not	die	not	afraid	of	him	.
and	if	so	,	might	this	suggest	a	reason	why	extraterrestrial
i	thought	you	stopped	calling	me	because	you	hate	what	i	've	become	.
on	behalf	of	my	peeps	,	let	me	just	say	thanks	for	dying	on	principle	for	us	.
i	do	n't	know	anyone	who	has	n't	needed	them	at	some	point	in	their	lives	.
and	then	i	could	spend	,	like	,	all	day	brushing	my	hair	.
i	know	,	i	always	think	of	them	as	botanical	amphibians	.
all	right	,	keep	on	trying	.	also	i	need	you	to	trace	this	.
if	you	believe	she	'll	let	you	live	,	give	her	the	data	.
we	must	cross	the	border	to	florence	to	get	there	.
well	,	he	performed	a	lot	of	them	at	my	bar	mitzvah	.
i	do	n't	trust	senator	ta	,	his	plans	for	our	world	after	the	war	.
but	how	do	we	know	this	is	the	same	slab
when	i	turn	,	i	break	every	bone	in	my	body	.
an	amateur	is	someone	whose	only	motivation	for	doing	something
i	never	even	saw	the	robber	.	and	even	if	i	did	...
she	's	crazy	!	you	just	saw	her	last	week	with	tick	-	tock	.
why	is	everyone	suddenly	breaking	down	this	case	but	me	?
great	.	we	can	go	to	that	restaurant	with	the	bacon	-	flavored	curly	fries	.
i	want	to	see	her	.	is	she	sexier	than	me	?
add	a	scoop	to	every	load	and	see	for	yourself	.
i	was	going	out	of	my	mind	.	so	you	just	-	took	off	?
i	'm	asking	the	well	-	dressed	gentleman	with	the	gun	.
and	if	that	does	n't	work	,	we	'll	look	to	plan	b.
so	to	keep	him	out	of	harm	's	way	,	she	drives	off	.
i	know	.	it	's	these	chinese	herbs	i	'm	taking	.	for	longer	life	.
people	still	die	of	hunger	.	have	you	fallen	from	the	moon	?
there	it	is	!	the	eight	...	she	dropped	it	.	hang	on	.
i	want	you	to	lock	your	door	,	close	and	lock	your	windows	.
but	if	you	try	anything	,	he	's	gon	na	blow	your	head	off	.
right	now	he	thinks	somebody	is	trying	to	kill	him	.
members	of	the	press	,	i	was	including	you	in	that	"	ladies	and	gentlemen	"	designation	.	thank	you	.
madame	,	l	can	see	only	one	ovum	on	the	right	.
rewards	the	men	in	her	narrative	with	a	formal	honorific	,
but	i	want	it	to	be	as	perfect	as	we	can	make	it	.
in	fact	,	you	were	on	a	desperate	peor	the	of	the	rocaninante	.
within	days	,	the	broken	ship	was	lost	to	the	deep	.
yeah	,	but	your	dad	could	n't	handle	what	she	was	doing	.
and	if	i	happen	to	find	a	few	kilos	of	cocaine	,	i	'll	call	you	.
i	'm	sure	i	got	him	.	he	had	a	green	turban	on	.
which	the	native	americans	taught	them	to	plant	and	fish	.
well	,	i	told	the	police	i	want	a	list	of	all	the	reported	break	-	ins	in	this	area
i	thought	we	could	go	sew	some	soccer	balls	together	.
no	,	it	's	me	again	.	i	'm	sorry	,	but	he	's	not	available	at	the	moment	.
it	means	your	majesty	is	the	son	of	heaven	and	earth
i	get	lots	of	phone	calls	but	this	one	's	the	dirtiest	.
your	mother	said	she	did	n't	know	whether	you	'd	be	home	or	not	.
we	know	more	about	what	we	need	to	fly	than	anybody	else	.
my	mom	's	had	a	lot	of	phases	.	anyway	,	i	figured	i	owe	you	.
we	're	gon	na	be	there	in	half	an	hour	.	-	perfect	.
if	i	were	you	,	i	'd	want	my	head	to	be	put	on	somebody	else	's	body	.
and	just	so	you	know	,	i	ca	n't	go	back	to	being	just	friends	,
come	on	,	the	best	part	about	making	a	baby	is	,
do	n't	worry	.	we	live	in	a	democracy	.	these	are	mere	cardboard	kings	.
but	if	i	find	you	have	grown	too	proud	i	will	be	sad	and	displeased	.
our	patient	's	unhappy	because	she	's	suffering	from	an	intestinal	blockage	.
at	night	you	can	sleep	soundly	on	one	of	the	two	delightful	queen	beds	provided	.
all	interior	hardware	(	i.e.	hinges	,	bolts	,	screws	,	etc	.	)	to	be	non	-	corrosive	.
which	leaves	me	no	chance	to	prove	any	of	this	.
but	if	you	want	to	find	a	definition	for	the	practice	,	probably	as	close	as	you	'll	get
i	'm	tired	of	you	women	,	that	it	can	not	say	.
i	'm	sorry	?	santa	claus	has	been	coming	here	for	years	.
since	you	paged	me	,	i	did	n't	want	to	keep	you	waiting	.
i	heard	you	were	friends	with	chun	-	hwa	but	you	had	a	fight
i	have	no	arab	friends	!	i	do	n't	want	arab	friends	!
rafi	.	this	is	my	son	ethan	.	he	's	a	good	jew	.
i	have	thought	about	this	a	lot	,	and	even	though	i	am	attracted	to	you	-
i	mean	,	how	else	am	i	supposed	to	get	this	back	from	you	?
i	came	home	from	school	with	a	form	to	fill	out	.
i	'd	be	better	if	you	were	n't	such	a	lying	piece	of	crap	.
please	note	that	the	hotel	will	be	closed	from	17th	feb	2012	and	reopening	3rd	march	2012	.
if	the	police	show	up	here	,	they	'll	take	me	back	to	prison	,
i	do	n't	want	to	come	off	like	a	lonely	loser	.
what	am	l	-	what	the	fuck	are	you	doing	here	?
lurid	events	are	the	work	of	that	very	same	psychotic	deviant	.
i	'm	the	client	,	you	moron	.	stacy	has	a	duty	to	this	hospital	.
you	take	the	lead	agent	down	,	the	rest	of	the	team	falls	.
if	the	smoke	gets	out	,	the	landlady	will	come	up	.
i	've	been	working	for	the	d.o.d	.	for	years	.
hey	,	who	did	that	?	who	's	letting	cherry	bombs	off	out	here	?
but	then	we	get	there	and	it	's	like	i	do	n't	even	exist	.
which	is	you	will	never	spend	a	day	in	jail	.
just	tell	them	you	came	and	that	...	ethan	get	in	.
i	still	think	with	you	you	are	rather	like	one	of	the	girls	in	the	competition	.
but	seeing	how	happy	she	is	,	i	ca	n't	argue	with	it	.
and	if	we	did	have	a	song	,	it	would	n't	be	this	song	.
and	as	a	corollary	the	market	for	technologies	is	shrinking	.
i	know	.	i	head	that	during	her	interview	she	turned	the	class	hamster	into	a	dove	.
26	hours	in	a	pullman	,	i	bet	you	'd	like	to	unwind	.
i	do	n't	care	if	this	is	nuts	,	and	i	do	n't	care	if	it	hurts	.	i	'm	doing	it	.
so	,	you	're	going	to	keep	me	until	the	condor	meeting	is	over	,	and	then	what	?
is	n't	it	right	that	i	missed	them	?	oh	,	yes	.	of	course	.
and	you	got	it	for	nothing	.	you	just	taped	your	neighbors	.
it	was	a	good	show	.	stop	saying	it	was	a	good	show	.	shh	!
but	the	crack	of	father	's	stick	across	my	knuckles	is	hard	to	forget	.
like	she	can	afford	all	that	shit	.	it	's	her	baby	anyway	.
yeah	,	well	we	had	to	.	did	you	decorate	in	here	?
i	been	passed	over	for	detective	twice	before	this	assignment	,
getting	free	pie	in	a	world	without	free	pie	was	pretty	cool	.
are	nothing	compared	with	what	you	'll	get	when	you	ascend	.
i	know	.	we	're	here	to	solve	a	couple	of	homicides	the	locals	keep	tripping	over	.
forgive	me	if	i	ca	n't	be	on	the	lookout	every	second	of	every	day	.
sorry	we	're	late	-	we	had	to	review	the	research	budget	.
you	can	just	come	pick	it	up	at	the	auditorium	at	4:00	tomorrow	.
i	was	working	for	wall	mart	all	along	or	something	.
okay	,	so	in	fact	this	paper	,	i	wrote	this	with	a	co	-	author	.
we	're	going	to	the	hospital	now	.	guys	,	guys	,	stop	fighting	.
plugging	him	in	the	ass	?	-	i	like	this	little	shitter	.
uh	,	guy	's	one	of	the	legendary	artisans	of	the	magic	world	.
no	one	knows	to	this	day	.	somehow	the	order	disappeared	into	thin	air	.
okay	?	and	besides	,	hey	-	hey	-	hey	no	one	is	even	gon	na	look	at	you	.
i	was	curious	about	how	you	see	things	working	out	for	you	and	sam	and	suzie	.
i	know	i	'm	not	your	favorite	person	right	now	,	but
i	mean	,	we	truly	look	like	father	and	son	now	.
oh	,	uh	,	i	cut	the	groom	a	very	special	deal	.
did	n't	i	tell	you	to	come	up	directly	.	it	is	nearly	dark	.
they	're	definitely	pushing	us	further	and	further	as	the	weeks	go	by	.
oh	,	my	god	.	she	took	me	on	a	hike	through	the	woods	...
if	we	win	today	it	will	be	the	best	result	for	a	british	side	in	decades	.
he	blew	up	my	wife	to	get	back	at	me	?
oh	,	damn	,	i	've	locked	myself	out	of	my	office	again	.
i	suppose	all	you	need	is	enough	people	to	worship	you	,
look	,	i	'd	like	to	take	you	up	on	your	little	offer	.
he	never	even	showed	up	.	i	did	n't	know	what	else	to	do	!
he	's	got	no	current	credit	cards	,	no	loans	,	no	leases	,	no	bank	accounts	,	no	job	.
do	i	bring	him	before	congress	,	expose	his	unfitness	to	the	american	people	?
well	,	this	is	a	small	town	so	you	are	going	to	have	to	be	the	one	to	tell	her
forgive	me	if	anything	i	said	,	if	i	upset	you	.
is	this	what	you	wanted	to	tell	me	before	the	bank	?	yes	.
it	'll	be	cool	if	she	can	see	the	mountain	over	there	too
you	'll	feel	right	at	home	at	best	western	lake	conroe	inn	.
he	never	ran	away	because	she	convinced	him	there	was	no	place	to	run	to	.
you	,	uh	,	did	n't	visit	her	apartment	later	that	day	,	did	you	?
i	mean	,	that	's	wild	,	is	n't	that	?	that	's	just	kind	of	serendipity	.
so	i	'm	just	gon	na	wait	here	till	he	shows	up	.
if	that	company	is	making	people	sick	,	you	have	to	stop	them	.
yes	,	although	a	bit	young	,	should	know	what	i	said	?
i	hate	to	say	it	,	but	when	times	are	tough
but	i	might	have	figured	out	what	she	was	doing	in	town	.
well	,	i	dare	say	i	should	.	well	,	off	you	go	to	bed	,	then	.
very	well	.	we	will	make	a	new	arrangement	.	you	bring	my	chips	here	tomorrow	,	and	we	trade	.
security	flaws	and	patch	them	before	a	hacker	works	out	how	to	get	in	.
and	so	our	voyage	of	discovery	has	come	to	an	end	.
take	him	to	interrogation	.	i	'll	meet	you	there	.	and	this	time	use	an	actual	room	,
do	you	remember	that	bamboo	field	you	woke	up	in
forget	nun	,	you	slept	with	a	patient	?	former	,	to	both	.
i	did	n't	expect	my	little	brother	to	be	banging	my	wife	!
hey	,	maybe	i	could	talk	about	that	on	the	show	.
and	if	we	expect	to	win	this	case	,	we	need	to	come	up	with	something
but	then	you	get	a	job	,	invite	people	for	dinner	.
i	was	expecting	a	little	bit	bigger	.	oh	,	tiny	bit	,	huh	?
i	wo	n't	tell	anyone	if	you	come	along	.	i	wo	n't	tell	anna	.
lying	over	700	miles	off	the	coast	of	south	america
made	it	to	the	top	.	but	look	what	it	cost	.
it	's	club	day	.	i	want	to	make	the	spring	sing	fling	.
i	-	i	know	more	about	this	stuff	than	you	do	.
and	if	so	,	it	follows	that	the	more	he	uses	it	-
and	i	know	you	probably	think	i	should	ask	mom	and	dad	for	the	money	,	but	...
all	right	,	you	're	alive	!	-	great	to	hear	your	voices	again
airport	car	airport	shuttle	must	be	scheduled	24	-	hours	in	advance
brandon	,	janet	and	i	are	all	washed	up	.	did	n't	you	know	?
subject	?	you	're	not	trying	this	l.	p.	crap	on	me	.
he	used	to	panhandle	in	front	of	this	theater	i	liked	to	go	to	.
where	there	's	a	weapon	,	there	's	crime	.	tensions	rose	,	and	rose	.
no	,	i	do	n't	think	i	can	take	any	more	steps	.	you	do	n't	wanna	hear	step	three	?
it	's	just	what	happens	to	your	judgment	the	second	you	're	drunk	or	getting	high	.
sometimes	facial	burn	victims	wear	a	clear	mask	during	treatment
oh	my	god	,	we	've	been	kidnaped.-	where	were	they	holding	you	?
you	think	they	were	threatened	?	no	,	he	thinks	they	were	altered	.
because	my	horoscope	said	it	was	gon	na	be	a	very	challenging	day	,
i	feel	the	same	way	.	can	we	keep	the	boat	too	?
if	you	made	it	to	the	finals	,	what	would	it	mean	to	you	?
i	never	do	it	but	i	went	up	to	him	.
these	caves	,	which	stretch	for	200	meters	,	include	the	caves	of	western	qin	,	north	wei	,	sui	,	tang	,	and	song	,	yuan	,	ming	,	qing	dynasties	.
yeah	,	about	that	i	prefer	to	sleep	on	the	right	side	.
god	loves	one	who	prays	well	more	than	one	who	cooks	well	.
i	ca	n't	come	right	now	.	the	houses	,	the	stores	are	all	empty	.
the	river	lodge	convention	center	is	just	across	the	street	,	which	makes	attending	meetings	,	events	or	conferences	a	breeze	.
are	you	writing	a	book	?	you	know	what	i	think	?
people	are	in	and	out	of	her	apartment	at	all	hours	-
i	keep	trying	to	tell	you	and	that	judge	that	i	do	not	get	angry	.
i	do	n't	want	to	go	through	it	anymore	.	i	do	n't	want	to	spend	another	day	,
i	,	too	,	have	forgotten	how	to	see	him	in	the	world	,
i	saw	someone	pull	around	by	your	car	.	you	did	?
if	we	were	balling	,	we	'd	be	going	together	.	i	do	n't	want	to	go	with	you	.
what	was	the	point	of	living	if	you	were	dead	?
yeah	,	i	did	,	why	,	is	it	yours	?	no	,	it	's	yours	.
in	the	broadcast	that	we	just	saw	on	the	monitor	,
hey	,	if	you	do	n't	wanna	kiss	me	,	it	's	ok	.	i	just	thought	it	may	be	...
i	mean	,	you	do	n't	just	shoot	an	airman	on	the	ground	.
i	'd	leave	him	tomorrow	if	only	i	had	more	money	and	no	kids	.
i	have	63	restaurants	worldwide	,	and	no	complaints	except	you	.
your	mother	had	saved	it	all	those	years	,	and	when	i	saw	it	,	i	...
he	's	got	every	reason	to	kill	you	and	no	reason	to	keep	you	alive	.
he	was	so	happy	.	i	have	never	seen	him	so	happy	ever	before	.
why	am	i	hesitating	?	so	what	if	she	has	a	husband	?
so	that	i	can	kill	myself	easily	at	any	time	.
oh	,	great	,	so	,	we	're	gon	na	snatch	a	murderer	with	some	magnets	and	a	roll	of	duct	tape	?
skimming	across	the	sea	like	a	bird	on	a	wing	.
he	tells	john	it	's	wrong	,	it	ca	n't	ever	happen	again	.
i	'm	going	to	see	if	your	hack	buddy	rider	england
if	you	do	not	oblige	me	in	this	matter	,	sir	,	l	believe	i	shall	scream	.
you	just	ca	n't	have	a	show	where	a	to	b	does	n't	make	any	sense	.
you	wo	n't	need	an	l	-	vad	or	any	other	kind	of	machinery	.
yeah	,	well	,	i	guess	there	's	still	a	little	of	you	left	inside	me	...
last	night	around	11	the	site	went	down	,	i	'd	hoped	forever	.
they	'll	just	be	waiting	for	a	chance	to	grab	our	weapons	.
and	you	help	us	i.	d.	the	guy	who	did	this	.
and	i	will	not	sell	these	people	off	at	any	price	.
i	can	make	it	work	.	i	can	give	you	some	indian	hair	.	-	yeah	.	that	's	right	.
if	i	was	n't	at	his	first	clinic	,	i	was	probably	at	his	second	.
oh	,	but	tom	,	i	repeat	,	if	you	need	to	use	my	organ
well	,	too	bad	she	's	not	my	girlfriend	,	you	little	fuck	...	oh	,	they	're	gone	.
but	if	your	boyfriend	comes	running	up	here	with	20	more	items	,
while	i	've	been	waiting	here	,	the	salt	lake	city	airport	has	been	closed	due	to	snow	.
yeah	,	in	those	nice	,	tight	pants	he	likes	'	cause	it	makes	his	dick	look	big	.
i	want	a	sledgehammer	,	i	want	a	crowbar	,	i	want	a	jackhammer	,	now	!
hello	?	you	're	late	.	what	did	i	say	would	happen	if	you	were	late	?
i	'm	gon	na	have	to	get	out	here	and	go	find	him	.
if	they	stay	on	the	team	,	we	clone	them	again	.
what	makes	you	think	that	you	can	actually	leave	tree	hill	?
the	karez	in	the	wuxing	township	are	open	to	visitors
take	motorway	a4	milan	to	venice	and	follow	the	directions	to	venice	.
you	look	beautiful	!	they	should	be	preserved	for	all	of	time	.
so	i	thought	maybe	it	was	just	a	sweet	night	.
happen	to	be	in	the	same	ballet	class	every	year
on	highway	69	(	jackson	street	)	on	the	left	,	just	past	beaumont	street	.
i	'm	gon	na	have	to	listen	to	her	complain	about	it	for	the	next	six	months	.
but	what	do	you	think	calvin	would	have	thought	of	that	?
rubbed	her	stapler	in	my	armpit	and	put	her	keyboard	on	my	butt	.
god	help	us	all	if	you	did	n't	shoot	them	,	i	suppose	,
i	was	in	circus	class	,	i	fell	off	my	stilts	.
it	's	halloween	day	,	so	come	on	down	to	the	docks	and	bring	your	costumes	!
that	's	the	stupidest	thing	you	could	do	.	-	shut	the	fuck	up	!
for	most	of	our	existence	,	we	used	relatively	simple	tools	.
but	i	've	done	nothing	wrong	.	you	have	to	believe	me	.
being	back	there	made	me	realize	this	is	where	want	to	be	.
when	you	're	saved	by	grace	,	grace	is	the	teacher	that	tells	you	...
no	matter	what	your	culinary	craving	is	,	there	's	a	restaurant	nearby	.
who	would	raise	the	kids	?	what	would	happen	then	?
but	i	'll	rip	your	throat	out	with	this	plastic	fork
that	she	had	to	make	a	stop	on	the	way	.	really	?
could	you	call	back	?	there	's	something	wrong	with	the	picture	.
i	am	happy	for	you	both	.	i	'm	gon	na	get	her	a	ring	.
yes	.	she	said	she	'd	written	it	the	morning	after	the	failed	exorcism	...
i	got	an	egg	roll	for	you	,	baby	.	-	yeah	,	you	do	!
on	the	other	hand	,	dinner	and	a	show	certainly	would	be	fun	,	would	n't	it	?
the	road	to	your	home	seems	further	and	further	away	,
and	that	's	why	you	are	here	in	our	top	20	.
so	high	school	administration	's	really	a	big	leap	for	me	.
i	mean	,	it	's	like	...	you	know	.	i	just	might	as	well	hop	up	.
he	's	rich	and	he	's	the	army	's	number	one	weapons	contractor	.
i	'm	like	no	,	i	got	to	get	that	one	.	i	'll	get	that	right	,	get	that	right	.
i	'm	not	going	to	get	him	because	i	'm	not	good	enough	.
your	ass	does	the	cutest	little	thing	when	you	bowl	.
i	've	changed	since	then	.	i	've	let	go	of	my	rottenness	.
i	'm	gon	na	circle	around	back	,	find	some	of	those	tiny	hot	dogs	.
when	you	spend	a	lot	of	time	in	dark	lockers
i	want	to	thank	you	all	for	being	here	with	me	to	celebrate	.
this	double	room	has	two	twin	beds	in	warm	modern	colors	with	air	conditioning	,	lcd	television	,	bathroom	with	shower	.
and	i	said	to	him	,	l	have	no	idea	how	to	shoot	a	gun	...
i	would	be	happy	to	win	this	one	,	and	that	's	it	.
what	if	i	told	you	it	was	for	a	case	?
you	swore	an	oath	to	defend	this	country	and	behave	with	moral	rectitude	.
i	wanted	to	get	a	boat	to	canada	.	i	got	stuck	here	.
only	thing	i	know	is	i	got	this	bad	feeling	inside	me	.
and	denying	his	repeated	please	to	get	on	a	battlefield	.
i	figured	instead	of	following	my	dream	of	being	an	animator	,	i	'm	just	gon	na	give	up	.
i	figured	out	where	this	ship	was	headed	before	it	was	attacked	.
come	on	,	no	one	goes	and	opens	a	bar	if	they	do	n't	like	people	.
slick	:	negative	on	the	intercept	,	trooper	,	you	got	your	own	plane	pal	to	deal	with	,
we	should	probably	begin	with	a	series	of	psychiatric	tests	...
the	young	all	emerge	within	a	day	or	two	,	a	marvel	of	timing	.
in	the	arena	,	to	be	executed	with	the	other	worthless	slaves	.
it	looked	like	there	was	a	lot	of	blood	,	thank	you	,
two	pills	?	yeah	.	every	day	,	for	at	least	a	month	,	with	a	meal	.
it	features	one	t	-	bar	and	a	conveyor	lift	,	serving	one	intermediate	slope	,	one	beginner	slope	,	and	a	snowboard	slope	.
i	'll	teach	you	to	behave	like	people	.
you	talk	about	life	as	if	it	had	some	deeper	significance	!
you	think	we	'll	be	able	to	take	it	out	of	the	water	?
it	has	n't	been	out	of	your	sight	all	day	?	no	.
the	child	.	i	must	baptize	it	before	the	lord	gathers	it	to	his	bosom	.
you	'd	head	down	to	harlan	to	reclaim	your	bullshit	empire	.
when	baby	's	away	,	it	's	hard	to	get	the	milk	going	.
i	did	what	i	had	to	do	.	they	said	they	were	sending	out	some	guys	.
we	need	to	make	sure	this	whole	thing	does	n't	fall	apart
i	would	have	tried	getting	shot	a	long	time	ago	.
little	did	i	know	i	was	living	on	a	floating	brothel	.
a	precaution	for	what	?	the	wraith	ship	crashed	thousands	of	years	ago	.
and	we	will	prevail	,	even	if	it	takes	all	night	!
but	you	obviously	are	just	as	desperate	to	fit	in	as	everyone	else	if	you	'll	date	her	.
why	do	n't	they	you	save	your	apologies	for	the	trial	?
but	we	can	be	fully	mobilized	and	on	site	in	an	hour	.
he	's	going	to	want	to	meet	mandeia	face	to	face	.
‘	cause	we	got	a	way	of	doing	things	so	they	stay	done	.
but	if	you	did	this	the	next	day	,	and	things	were	independent
excellent	.	-	there	are	n't	street	fights	in	a	winter	's	tale	.
you	've	damned	yourself	to	an	eternity	without	lisa	and	katie	.
a	man	like	hollin	would	n't	hesitate	to	eat	his	young	.
why	do	n't	we	have	two	sexy	women	mud	-	wrestling	?
i	know	your	legs	are	short	,	but	you	can	do	it	.
i	do	n't	care	.	i	have	to	get	him	out	.	if	he	runs	,	it	's	on	me	.
restaurant	dolce	serves	breakfast	and	dinner	.
in	the	middle	of	the	night	dressed	like	a	hooker	?
so	as	i	was	saying	,	now	that	i	'm	in	charge
what	will	l	have	to	do	to	make	you	say	those	words	?
i	'm	not	going	to	authorize	your	release	until	i	see	some	real	progress	.
the	general	secretary	of	the	sug	's	cc	and	chairman	of	the	gdr	's	council	of	state	,
four	documents	.	these	first	two	are	common	stock	purchase	agreements	,
yes	,	she	is	,	but	do	you	know	the	one	thing	she	's	missing	?
and	i	'm	gon	na	have	payroll	send	you	over	some	pretend	checks	starting	tomorrow	.
see	anyone	fitting	that	description	up	there	in	red	heaven	?
i	am	sick	and	tired	of	picking	up	your	slack	,	too	!
he	's	the	one	who	puts	the	whole	show	together	covers	the	angles	.
i	'd	kick	your	ass	for	thinking	you	had	anything	to	do	with	her	.
yeah	.	gosh	,	you	look	so	sad	.	you	look	like	a	little	boy	.
that	guy	,	lovejoy	,	put	it	in	my	pocket	.	-	i	know	.
taxi	cab	service	as	well	as	local	bus	service	is	available	to	this	station	.
and	on	the	night	he	died	the	last	thing	he	said	to	her	was	.
i	know	what	you	're	going	for	with	these	murals	,	but	perhaps	if	they	were	n't	so	large	.
i	went	to	do	it	,	but	she	was	over	the	moon	about	that	stupid	interview	.
screw	yo	,	corella	.	how	the	hell	does	she	do	this	?
laura	kept	a	duplicate	key	at	her	office	.	i	went	over	and	got	it	.
it	's	impossible	to	get	at	without	damage	to	the	intervening	tissue	,
i	'm	going	to	ask	him	to	move	out	when	he	returns	.
how	come	you	can	work	over	here	if	you	're	a	yank	?
what	does	it	look	like	i	'm	doing	?	i	'm	getting	on	with	my	day	.
i	would	never	be	in	the	weeds	.	i	'm	too	good	of	a	waitress	.
my	god	,	i	had	no	notion	of	a	love	affair	.
yeah	,	and	what	's	with	your	grandmother	staring	like	she	wants	to	kill	me	?
i	'd	wear	a	vest	if	i	were	you	.	if	you	're	not	looking	to	get	shot	.
who	's	been	waiting	in	that	room	for	over	two	hours	now	.
she	's	not	cut	out	to	be	a	mother	at	15	.
there	was	a	goddamn	coffee	can	on	top	of	that	fridge	!
oh	my	god	,	please	do	n't	hurt	us	-	please	get	out	of	our	car	-
i	was	told	to	ask	you	by	a	woman	.	thought	you	had	a	kindness	about	you	.
afternoon	.	got	a	reservation	for	a	mr	.	and	mrs	.	frank	sullivan	.
in	three	years	i	'll	be	married	to	a	chinese	woman	.
oh	,	and	do	n't	bother	bringing	her	downtown	.	what	do	you	mean	?
is	that	true	,	mr	.	byoum	?	i	'd	rather	not	say	,	sir	.
just	got	to	get	past	this	crap	with	my	investors	now	.
i	do	not	want	to	compete	for	your	attention	with	a	sandwich	.
yeah	,	you	're	right	.	there	are	hundreds	of	other	nightmare	scenarios	far	worse	.
the	best	western	plus	deridder	inn	suites	is	on	the	left	on	us	171	.
can	i	see	it	?	what	did	you	try	?	-	uh	,	a	dry	iron	and	u.v	.	light	.
and	you	're	gettin	'	all	righteous	,	which	we	both	know	is	a	crock	.
i	love	the	whole	ensemble	.	i	love	the	whole	stilettos	.
i	could	wait	outside	,	but	the	coffee	would	get	cold	.
you	'	blessed	me	with	a	lot	:	more	money	i	know	what	to	do	with	a	beautiful	home	,
you	want	to	knock	out	?	i	can	knock	you	out	.
there	's	been	a	lot	more	not	music	stuff	than	i	thought	.
i	do	n't	think	i	ever	knew	what	relief	meant	until	that	moment	.
yeah	,	and	you	're	going	to	help	him	,	all	right	?	you	took	an	oath	.
i	've	loved	that	woman	for	a	lot	of	years	,	bro	.
yes	,	but	then	i	took	her	to	school	yesterday
all	right	,	cindy	.	i	'm	gon	na	have	to	take	you	down	to	the	station	.
sir	,	we	're	prepared	to	give	you	a	real	-	time	uplink	to	our	satellite	feed	of	the	assault	operation	.
said	he	was	doing	business	in	the	area	.	-	what	kind	of	business	?
my	mother	wrote	me	you	was	in	the	body	-	snatching	business	.
she	's	not	getting	out	of	this	royal	mess	anytime	soon	.
security	cams	picked	up	a	pretty	clean	image	of	this	clown	.
i	'll	drive	him	there	myself	if	that	's	what	it	takes	.
she	said	any	parent	who	does	n't	want	to	know	things	is	living	in	denial	.
but	we	need	the	missing	three	d	'	anna	to	bring	them	out	into	the	open	.
the	baby	was	taken	from	her	,	of	course	.	evelyn	was	institutionalized	.
i	can	take	you	no	further	than	the	main	road	.	after	that	,	you	have	to	find	someone	else	.
oh	,	man	,	do	n't	worry	about	that	,	man	.	ai	n't	nobody	gon	na	take	you	nowhere	.
they	do	the	best	ham	and	pineapple	on	the	island	...
and	i	do	n't	need	you	to	be	mine	.	that	's	kind	of	what	makes	us	awesome	.
we	've	got	him	.	bring	in	the	follow	teams	.	tell	'em	to	stay	at	a	safe	distance	.
if	the	hr	guy	likes	you	,	the	job	is	yours	.
hey	,	whatever	she	told	you	about	me	everything	.	it	's	all	true	.
but	you	still	have	the	option	of	going	to	the	end	of	the	deck
they	wanted	a	bill	passed	-	a	bill	to	help	seniors	with	their	prescriptions	.
but	sometimes	the	best	way	to	get	over	somebody	is	to	get	under	somebody	else	.
i	do	n't	want	to	have	to	be	his	best	man	a	third	time，if	you	know	what	i	mean	.
before	tonight	,	he	was	in	the	shadows	,	picking	us	off	one	by	one	.
a	day	at	the	aquarium	is	a	surefire	way	to	keep	your	youngest	explorers	engaged	and	excited	.
how	unfortunate	for	the	show	and	for	america	if	we	had	done	that	.
i	ran	away	from	him	but	then	i	got	lost	.
i	'd	say	this	tomb	is	much	older	than	the	skull	.
and	right	on	top	of	the	garage	is	a	perfect	,	all	iit	-	up	christmas	tree	.
i	saw	him	on	the	roof	of	the	bandeaux	building	.
if	she	feels	the	least	bit	threatened
when	you	're	sitting	on	the	side	of	the	road	picking	up	styrofoam	and	wads	of	gum	,
maybe	we	should	both	get	under	it	,	since	we	're	so	cold	.
you	really	got	me	spun	about	what	you	said	last	night	...
he	's	a	sweet	kid	.	he	's	a	really	sweet	kid	.	he	's	got	a	great	personality	.
there	's	something	your	mom	and	i	need	to	tell	you	.
looks	like	your	dad	's	home	.	we	startled	wary	wart	hogs	...
what	if	i	could	plant	you	around	a	few	spots	?	you	know	,	radio	,	tv	.
yeah	,	l	need	you	to	get	in	your	car	and	drive	away	first	.
i	spent	118	days	out	here	on	my	own	.	good	for	you	i	'm	coming	up	on	a	thousand	.
but	i	've	come	to	the	understanding	that	i	'm	not	a	woman	.
when	i	arrived	,	i	found	no	sign	of	forced	entry	.
and	i	do	n't	see	you	wearing	any	pants	in	that	equation	.
i	know	this	is	probably	the	worst	pain	you	have	ever	felt	.
sorry	,	bro	.	i	have	n't	been	to	a	boob	bar	in	forever	,	homey	.
i	did	n't	leave	,	you	threw	me	out	.	-	i	did	n't	throw	you	out	.
hey	,	all	due	respect	,	but	does	anybody	ever	read	your	column	?
i	sensed	him	being	a	little	dramatic	.	but	with	holding	food	?
and	,	if	possible	,	to	end	it	.	tell	me	your	ideas	.
it	is	n't	time	to	go	up	to	the	boats	yet	!
mom	,	i	've	got	your	car	keys	,	and	i	've	got	your	wallet	.
so	you	got	no	idea	what	he	looks	like	tall	,	short	,	heavyset	,	blond	,	brunette	...	stop	me	here	.
relax	in	our	2	-	room	,	smoking	-	permitted	suite	complete	with	a	king	bed	and	sofa	bed	for	those	extra	guests	.
i	know	,	but	i	do	n't	think	anybody	else	is	going	to	show	up	with	a	chauffeur	.
how	many	times	before	he	started	feeling	the	effects	?	well	,	he	did	n't	have	a	specific	amount	,
you	might	not	want	to	open	that	can	of	worms	.
and	that	all	the	pleasure	you	took	in	building	your	business	evaporated
plenty	of	room	.	you	want	to	come	along	?	thanks	,	mate	.
her	car	's	missing	,	and	i	'm	sure	that	the	killer	used	it	to	move	her	body	to	the	park	,
well	,	i	see	you	got	through	another	year	of	school	.
after	i	give	you	the	best	orgasm	you	've	ever	had	.
i	hope	you	do	n't	mind	.	i	tried	to	ring	the	bell	,	but	nobody	answered	.
put	on	your	rubber	boots	'cause	here	comes	the	bullshit	.
kind	of	like	the	one	i	saw	you	in	the	other	night	.
yes	?	and	do	you	take	brackett	to	be	your	wedded	husband	...
and	i	know	it	's	such	a	stretch	-	be	able	to	do	the	character	and	perform	,
so	he	left	a	lot	of	enemies	in	his	wake	.
you	've	got	me	right	here	in	this	car	with	you	,	you	lucky	woman	,	you	,
white	in	beginning	and	after	that	we	give	this	on	the	top	of	that	.
the	world	's	coming	to	an	end	.	-	what	are	you	talking	about	?
i	hope	they	make	it	over	the	border	.	let	the	feds	take	it	.
week	by	week	you	should	be	better	not	slide	back	.
no	one	died	,	and	as	far	as	i	can	tell	,
your	mom	said	you	had	it	since	you	were	6	.
yeah	and	i	found	you	one	too	who	is	not	a	weirdo	.
and	where	did	we	go	?	the	dark	side	of	the	moon	.
and	check	your	cuts	.	these	bad	boys	know	our	blood	now	.
it	was	ginny	who	set	the	basilisk	on	mudblood	and	filch	's	cat
you	've	got	ta	look	after	yourself	.	you	've	only	got	one	pair	of	eyes	.
i	was	the	only	member	of	my	family	who	made	it	out	.
it	's	even	better	when	it	works	.	i	was	going	through	to	my	dad	's	notes	...
do	n't	worry	,	gaz	.	put	a	bit	of	salt	on	that	.
if	you	worked	in	germany	,	you	would	know	the	language	.
all	we	got	to	do	is	to	put	these	controls
i	was	tired	.	i	was	pissed	.	i	was	wetter	than	drew	barrymore	at	a	grunge	club	.
but	in	the	interest	of	full	disclosure	,	i	was	once	on	a	bus
next	up	,	a	64	year	old	memphis	legend	.
of	course	not	,	but	set	aside	the	rhetoric	and	analyze	what	mr	.	black	said	.
no	funnier	,	however	,	than	they	would	be	if	they	all	sat	down	on	pork	pies	.
today	's	the	big	day	.	you	should	say	something	to	them	.
i	'm	the	police	.	i	'll	talk	to	him	however	i	want	.
you	have	to	be	the	best	little	worker	you	can	be	...
if	anything	happens	to	me	,	you	need	to	call	that	number	,
i	am	about	to	activate	the	most	powerful	weapon	in	the	world	.
custom	pillow	fabrications	or	those	not	produced	as	standard	items	shall	be	preceded	by	the	submission	of	shop	drawings	.
he	keeps	changing	his	rental	cars	on	us	every	couple	of	days	.
like	it	was	worth	the	ten	g	's	that	we	found	in	your	purse	.
our	non	-	smoking	mobility	accessible	room	has	plenty	of	room	for	all	your	needs	.
oh	...	there	was	a	lot	of	gun	fires	.
i	think	the	nova	does	look	like	the	mandala	inside	of	this	temple	.
he	's	not	answering	his	cell	.	i	'm	kind	of	freaking	out	.
if	he	can	still	show	his	face	in	the	state	of	colorado	...
look	,	the	safe	house	was	bad	.	the	agents	are	dead	...
yes	,	what	is	it	you	've	found	that	the	local	hacks	are	buzzing	about	?
who	do	you	think	sent	that	picture	from	your	phone	?
the	average	lily	commute	is	16	miles	one	-	way	,
mind	if	i	ask	if	you	saw	anything	going	on	?
i	heard	the	hood	foiled	an	armored	car	heist	this	evening	.
we	're	gon	na	do	this	together	because	we	need	to	get	this	baby	out	.	i	need	you	to	push	.
which	,	if	i	am	right	,	will	force	the	faerie	out	of	the	girl	.
what	's	the	point	of	just	meandering	through	the	desert	if	....
oh	,	yeah	,	'cause	niagara	's	where	all	the	well	-	adjusted	single	men
yeah	,	you	think	you	're	screwed	?	i	've	got	eighteen	go	pilots	.
well	,	this	is	really	bad	now	.	i	really	am	in	a	bad	situation	now	.
yeah	,	i	used	my	credit	card	down	here	to	fix	a	bus	.	why	?
sophomore	year	of	college	i	walked	away	from	an	academic	scholarship
you	spend	all	day	lounging	in	a	bed	of	noble	thoughts	,
imbued	an	ordinary	jar	with	the	power	to	make	others
i	will	tell	you	that	these	are	all	classic	symptoms
no	difference	to	them	.	-	nor	does	catching	the	killer	,	for	that	matter	.
you	're	going	to	choose	one	person	to	go	with	you	.
i	have	a	feeling	that	things	may	not	be	very	good	for	him	right	now	.
nah	,	nobody	does	.	that	's	why	i	need	more	than	one	.
that	suck	blood	towards	the	heart	the	air	mixes	with	blood	,
madame	should	think	about	what	a	man	and	a	woman	do	alone	.
all	of	this	was	in	the	report	i	filed	two	days	ago	.	if	you	change	...
you	know	,	i	went	out	with	a	woman	who	had	a	little	kid	once	.
i	know	what	a	fan	you	are	of	the	subway	system	,
like	you	're	trying	to	drown	out	some	annoying	noise	and	let	them	lead	the	way
but	i	could	n't	shake	this	feeling	that	i	should	warn	the	couple	somehow	.
thanks	for	coming	to	the	wedding	.	it	was	a	ball	,
come	on	,	charlie	.	i	think	it	's	time	we	let	your	grandparents	get	some	sleep	.
and	it	will	be	just	about	impossible	to	completely	remove	the	mercury	from	the	room	.
i	could	have	had	them	blown	back	to	the	stone	age	.
what	do	i	need	from	him	to	get	the	israelis	to	camp	david	?
do	you	know	,	i	asked	him	for	menu	suggestions	.	do	you	know	what	he	says	?
if	i	did	that	i	'd	put	my	position	at	risk	.
so	i	'd	like	you	to	go	out	there	and	cope	.
yes	,	and	i	've	jumped	through	hoops	to	prove	it	to	you	.
i	ca	n't	do	this	.	the	set	list	is	at	the	front	.
very	well	.	-	main	seawater	pump	is	out	of	commission	.
and	he	'll	say	,	"	that	's	very	good	,	frank	.	keep	it	up	.	”
with	the	training	over	,	it	's	time	to	travel	over	the	ice	to	the	dive	site	,
so	i	really	hope	you	ai	n't	expecting	shit	from	me	today	!
the	tech	team	went	over	every	inch	of	your	place	.
you	know	what	he	's	going	through	right	now	with	his	dad	.
but	i	think	i	think	i	would	book	her	definitely	.
i	come	strong	,	then	you	come	in	.	right	.	got	it	.
you	want	me	to	get	the	files	?	i	'll	get	the	files	!
what	's	happening	here	?
oh	,	and	by	the	way	,	you	're	still	welcome	to	stay	till	you	find	a	place	.
that	you	'd	stop	treating	me	like	some	baby	bird	you	had	to	protect	!
well	,	i	hope	she	figures	it	out	soon	because	i	'm	hungry	.
yeah	,	i	heard	he	got	crushed	under	a	vending	machine	.
i	got	the	wallet	.	he	hired	a	girl	.	it	got	ugly	.	she	took	his	stuff	.
come	on	.	it	was	always	gon	na	be	just	a	matter	of	time	with	her	.
i	can	reconstruct	the	map	.	it	'll	just	take	a	bit	more	time	.
make	a	casey	anthony	face	at	her	casey	anthony	lawyer	.
mm	-	hm	,	i	know	.	that	's	why	i	used	the	salt	from	your	utility	belt	.
go	home	,	pack	a	bag	,	and	we	'll	be	right	now	people	.
i	like	a	guy	,	he	's	in	love	with	my	older	sister	...
who	does	he	think	he	is	,	thinking	that	we	've	got	problems	?
i	want	you	to	rip	open	her	blouse	first	.	better	yet	,	use	the	knife	.
it	'll	just	be	a	good	way	for	you	to	get	to	know	the	lads	a	bit	.	and	-	?
he	wanted	so	much	to	know	what	that	felt	like	.
the	number	you	are	calling	is	not	available	at	the	moment	.
did	you	ever	have	to	kill	someone	while	you	're	changing	a	tire	?
if	you	'll	make	your	way	back	to	your	seat	.	that	's	okay	.
if	it	was	any	other	sovereign	nation	,	sir	,	i	'd	urge	negotiations	-
they	are	using	again	stucco	and	paint	to	make	a	wall	,
what	is	happening	in	oakland	?	have	won	seven	in	a	row	.
i	do	n't	inhale	.	you	are	such	a	liar	.	i	do	n't	believe	it	.
i	mean	,	do	n't	you	have	any	more	important	crimes	to	investigate	?
i	'm	sure	someone	just	wanted	to	move	things	along	faster	.
mama	-	just	see	my	painting	-	it	's	the	wicked	witch	!
you	must	n't	mind	her	,	lieutenant	.	she	always	wants	to	get	into	the	act	.
but	set	theory	was	n't	really	working	,	so	then	i	applied
i	ca	n't	stop	for	a	dog	.	well	,	and	then	let	me	out	.
sorry	,	but	i	would	rather	have	rabid	ferrets	munch	on	me	testicles	.
what	would	you	call	it	then	?	i	joined	the	marines	.
both	were	low	risk	.	he	could	just	be	picking	them	at	random	.
i	ca	n't	get	my	hair	done	.	i	ca	n't	eat	at	a	restaurant	.
do	you	even	remember	what	it	was	like	being	a	kid	?
these	rooms	feature	one	queen	bed	,	free	wi	-	fi	,	microwave	,	refrigerator	,	coffee	maker	and	hairdryer	.
replacing	the	toilet	with	a	low	-	flow	model	,	much	more	efficient	.
because	i	think	she	deserves	a	last	name	that	cool	.
but	we	want	to	be	able	to	intercept	any	future	images	.
he	kept	calling	his	mom	and	sisters	asking	them	what	they	ate	.
no	,	but	they	came	after	us	.	what	do	you	mean	they	came	after	you	?
that	is	the	one	thing	i	am	not	doing	.	ok	,	look	,
but	listen	,	if	it	's	too	much	of	a	gesture	,	i	could	put	you	down	right	now	.
george	,	what	time	did	the	master	say	he	'll	be	home	?
when	the	kids	were	just	kids	.	and	everyone	was	happy	.
both	times	i	went	into	remission	,	and	both	times	the	cancer	came	back	.
who	believes	censorship	reflects	society	's	lack	of	confidence	in	itself	.
i	just	do	n't	want	to	see	you	waste	your	time	.
they	would	n't	have	brought	this	upon	themselves	if	that	's	what	you	're	thinking	.
hey	,	do	n't	use	vulgar	language	when	you	talk	about	her	.
small	world	.	yeah	,	we	make	it	small	when	we	want	to	.
however	,	i	can	offer	no	tangible	evidence	on	his	behalf	.
but	for	the	highest	frequency	ones	,	you	hear	a	continuous	tone	.
i	'm	going	to	stop	there	and	we	'll	pick	up	on	this	topic	,
hey	,	yo	,	krista	the	barista	,	put	it	on	my	account	...
i	feel	like	i	got	so	much	to	learn	from	you	.
but	for	the	other	five	,	the	dream	will	be	over	.
yes	,	a	little	,	sir	.	tell	her	to	visit	.	with	a	friend	.
i	do	n't	think	so	.	-	no	,	you	're	not	a	slut	.
i	had	one	thing	on	her	,	and	she	tried	to	kill	me	.
i	mean	,	who	says	this	is	a	wedding	dress	anyway	?
if	we	could	just	find	this	guy	you	were	with	...
sir	,	we	were	lucky	that	you	were	here	last	night	.
onto	my	mind	it	's	an	abomination	to	consider	it	to	any	man	,	woman	or	child	.
but	do	n't	ask	me	to	leave	.	that	's	the	one	thing	i	ca	n't	do	.
where	i	come	from	it	do	n't	pay	to	read	and	speak	white	.
pck	up	your	gun	.	i	know	i	'm	gong	to	beat	you	anyway
suddenly	,	what	you	know	to	be	impossible	is	the	only	thing	anyone	else	will	believe	,
i	will	likely	be	replaced	by	someone	more	amenable	to	cohen	.
complimentary	continental	breakfast	,	choice	of	breads	,	cereal	,	fruit	,	eggs	,	yogurt	,	juice	,	coffee	and	hot	items
it	would	n't	be	possible	for	me	to	remember	what	it	said
now	,	if	your	truck	has	a	square	-	flanged	intake	manifold	,
do	you	want	me	to	give	the	words	of	command	?	yes	.
but	i	want	a	list	of	questions	ahead	of	time	,
oh	,	those	just	get	me	psychotic	!	-	yeah	,	me	too	.
as	are	the	largest	grazers	of	them	all	,	the	woolly	mammoths	.
in	some	instances	these	requirements	may	exceed	nfpa	code	or	local	jurisdictional	requirements	.
it	really	is	a	melting	pot	of	various	immigrants	'	traditions	and	beliefs	.
that	our	corn	chowder	gets	its	flavour	from	a	cockroach	.
as	we	have	n't	got	it	,	they	're	never	going	to	kill	us	.
a	lot	of	people	will	talk	to	you	that	wo	n't	talk	to	me	.
we	have	to	hope	we	can	get	some	information	out	of	her	.
yeah	,	which	,	by	the	way	chandler	,	i	would	like	back	one	of	these	days	.
that	his	science	based	solution	would	appear	so	religious
a	911	call	from	my	office	.	i	'll	be	back	as	soon	as	i	can	.
i	accidentally	overheard	her	when	i	was	listening	at	the	door	.
i	do	n't	think	it	's	smart	to	put	holes	in	things	that	sink	or	breathe	.
why	in	the	world	do	you	wear	boys	'	husky	underwear	?
yes	,	and	be	sure	and	put	on	the	emergency	brake	.
who	's	that	?	look	at	him	!	oh	,	you	're	so	cute	.	what	's	his	name	?
goody	-	two	shoes	,	but	you	're	like	a	fugitive	from	the	law	.
couple	of	agents	heard	him	and	wanted	to	bring	him	to	california
we	can	see	a	part	of	the	spectrum	from	red	,
would	you	be	willing	to	go	on	record	with	this	?
and	near	as	anyone	can	tell	about	a	thousand	years	old	.
she	wants	to	see	me	settled	down	before	she	-
it	's	something	that	you	will	not	understand	.	i	do	not	want	to	be	like	you	.
except	for	the	fact	that	the	bastards	fragged	our	phone	.
i	'll	run	point	on	this	.	i	know	the	lab	.	i	know	the	protocols	.
or	not	one	of	their	fanatical	legions	of	evangelical	hand	puppets	.
that	led	to	a	trail	of	toxic	smoke	and	ash
i	have	never	seen	something	so	offensive	in	my	life	.
i	'm	afraid	there	will	be	no	leaving	the	mansion	tonight	.
you	know	,	to	smile	to	make	them	feel	better	about	their	boring	life	.
down	here	we	have	a	man	hating	and	angry	as	fuck	,
yeah	,	well	,	that	's	good	.	because	newman	and	l	,	we	think	-
larry	makes	some	great	diversionary	fuss	to	show	how	moral	he	is	.
well	,	i	would	,	but	they	all	died	of	radiation	poisoning	.
if	we	make	your	older	brother	your	chaperone	for	the	evening	.
i	'm	gon	na	start	doing	that	work	that	you	recommended	that	i	do	.
oh	,	sorry	,	but	i	am	taking	my	son	on	a	dicey	single	-	mom	lunch	.
well	,	even	though	that	was	a	scam	and	they	were	n't	sued	,	their	bottom	line	got	crushed	.
just	colleagues	,	can	i	still	ask	you	how	you	are	?
well	,	i	just	-	i	'm	so	excited	i	ca	n't	wait	to	start	helping	those	kids
i	once	met	to	have	before	personal	to	control	what	offense	care	nothing	about
and	i	watched	the	world	be	cruel	to	you	,	so	...
i	have	an	idea	for	you	to	save	some	money
yo	ho	yo	ho	a	pirate	's	life	for	me	.
when	this	truck	's	full	,	gon	na	drive	it	into	the	bay	.
so	you	are	the	one	who	wants	to	command	one	of	my	squads	?
because	it	was	just	a	dream	,	and	dreams	do	n't	mean	anything	.
we	better	go	.	he	might	come	back	.	oh	,	my	goodness	.
oh	,	this	is	n't	still	on	,	is	it	?	what	a	yawn	festival	.
serving	everything	from	bugers	and	appetizers	to	the	finest	steaks	and	entrees	in	the	valley	.
i	know	leroy	's	always	saying	the	wrong	thing	,	but	he	's	a	good	man	.
to	some	kind	of	nocturnal	civil	defense	air	raid	siren
two	different	worlds	met	on	this	spot	one	of	love	the	other	of	hate	.
when	i	got	back	to	school	,	even	with	a	wig	,
the	final	three	have	been	home	and	received	a	hero	's	welcome	.
he	has	n't	been	in	school	all	week	.	he	would	n't	just	leave	.
they	closed	the	access	road	down	the	night	of	the	murder	.
at	these	four	-	star	restaurants	,	not	all	the	wild	animals	end	up	on	your	plate	.
oh	,	jeez	.	this	is	what	i	needed	,	you	guys	-
the	people	wo	n't	hear	it	,	no	matter	what	you	say	.
well	,	protocol	dictates	we	contact	a.	p.	o	,	let	them	know	what	's	going	on	.
being	a	cop	.	why	'd	you	get	into	being	a	cop	?
oh	,	and	then	monica	joked	that	she	would	n't	go	out	with	a	guy	like	chandler	...
i	've	done	everything	you	want	.	when	do	i	get	my	family	back	?
what	kind	of	bullets	were	the	victims	shot	with	?	copper	jacket	,	lead	core	.
this	means	so	much	to	me	,	you	have	no	idea	this	is	just	super
i	'm	gon	na	stay	with	her	until	she	goes	to	sleep	.
my	first	concern	is	with	the	safety	of	my	people	,
both	rooms	have	a	32	-	inch	flat	screen	tv	,	and	there	is	a	cozy	fireplace	in	the	living	room	.
now	,	i	rented	a	truck	,	and	i	parked	it	in	the	parking	lot	behind	the	electronics	store	.
i	'm	afraid	of	you	.	ok	alright	,	let	me	stay	with	you	.
mom	,	do	n't	worry	.	it	's	a	good	thing	.	tell	me	then	.
we	need	to	sign	him	or	try	to	sign	him	.
do	n't	worry	,	if	nude	fondue	does	n't	make	your	father	want	me	back
fancy	a	kick	about	?	-	mm	,	d	'	you	mind	if	we	do	n't	right	now	?
well	,	some	of	our	neighbors	think	you	're	a	little	distant	.
have	you	been	talking	to	her	?	is	there	something	the	matter	?
any	old	girlfriend	in	high	school	who	says	you	hit	her	,
let	me	begin	by	explaining	the	complex	numbers	on	the	blackboard	.
i	need	to	go	.	i	got	another	call	.	i	do	too	!
a	fuel	truck	just	pulled	up	next	to	the	bunker
when	l	heard	the	lie	come	out	of	my	mouth	,	l	knew	l	was	interested	.
it	is	also	home	to	shaftesbury	abbey	museum	and	garden	and	gold	hill	museum	and	garden	.
i	get	paid	a	visit	from	a	partner	in	firm	.
we	're	all	the	real	victims	paralyzed	by	the	sexual	harassment	laws
i	know	how	you	feel	but	i	do	n't	think	that	's	love
let	us	guys	catch	up	here	a	little	bit	.
her	cell	phone	shows	a	call	to	him	around	the	time	of	the	disappearance	.
i	'm	sorry	.	you	must	have	the	wrong	door	.	little	girl	.
so	i	had	no	choice	but	to	check	him	out	.
is	that	she	must	have	drugged	me	.	i	think	-
do	you	want	me	to	slip	that	file	back	in	the	box	before	your	mother	notices	?
lab	tech	:	okay	,	you	are	all	set	.	remember	to	make	that	.
i	wanted	all	of	us	to	really	think	about	it	.
it	was	me	who	used	magic	to	cure	gwen	's	father	.
now	stop	wasting	me	and	mel	gibson	's	time	,	you	little	wussy	prick	.
my	first	reaction	was	oh	,	brother	.	here	we	go	,	something	else	to	worry	about	.
quick	,	maybe	you	can	tell	me	you	love	me	or	something	.
today	would	be	the	day	i	'd	know	if	i	'd	have	to	say	good	-	bye	to	my	family	.
but	we	could	build	a	profile	,	you	know	a	woman	,
you	're	just	going	to	skate	in	a	different	city	,	that	's	all	.
give	up	any	hope	of	a	normal	life	and	-
he	started	to	like	attack	me	,	and	he	just	would	n't	stop	,
he	's	the	only	one	like	that	.	the	rest	of	us	are	very	sensitive	.
and	we	ask	the	public	not	to	call	in	,	so	that	the	zodiac	himself	can	reach	us	.
so	if	you	're	worried	about	us	,	do	n't	worry	about	us	,	man	.
i	know	you	do	n't	want	to	give	him	up	for	even	a	second	,
it	honors	the	20	most	beautiful	women	in	the	city	,
you	are	like	some	damn	roller	coaster	ride	,	you	know	that	?
like	the	entire	universe	coursing	through	you	all	at	once	.
the	lab	also	have	turned	up	traces	of	ammonium	hydroxide	on	the	straps	of	the	bag	.
yes	,	uh	,	i	'm	looking	for	someone	who	seems	to	have	gotten	lost	.
dressed	in	orange	to	avoid	each	other	but	a	colour	that	elk	ca	n't	see
the	micro	fracturing	on	the	victim	's	ribs	did	not	occur	due	to	electrical	shock	,
it	's	mostly	honey	,	but	they	put	these	herbs	in	it	.
um	,	do	you	remember	the	first	time	that	you	were	ever	really	,	really	embarrassed	by	one	of	your	parents	?
hold	it	!	i	did	not	just	cook	for	eight	hours
uh	,	is	it	...	that	's	not	...	the	guy	in	the	blue	suit	,	is	he	just	around	the	corner	?	can	you	...	?
please	note	these	documents	are	being	transmitted	for	the	recently	signed	management	contract	,	sheraton	fuzhou	fuqing	hotel	.
one	of	the	few	still	alive	.	what	's	he	done	here	in	portland	?
you	told	me	you	only	had	eyes	for	that	stupid	sophomore	.
this	new	non	-	smoking	room	is	pet	friendly	with	a	king	sized	bed	,	hard	flooring	and	42	-	inch	lcd	tv	.
well	,	i	was	more	enthusiastic	about	the	opportunity	than	you	were	.
who	would	be	be	stupid	enough	to	give	up	his	heart	?
and	there	are	other	people	in	the	lab	and	they	're	being	so	noisy	.
buttress	root	drumming	had	never	been	filmed	here	before	but	she	was	always	just	a	bit	too	late	.
i	thought	i	was	trying	out	a	new	masseuse	in	here	.
you	know	you	're	new	and	i	totally	took	advantage	of	the	situation	.
because	technically	,	it	's	the	weapon	of	interest	in	two	separate	cases	.
there	's	plenty	of	room	in	our	non	-	smoking	room	with	two	queen	beds	that	have	pillow	top	mattresses	.
and	as	a	reward	for	years	of	loyal	service	,	they	sent	two	guys	out	here	to	kill	her	.
we	'll	be	right	back	with	a	check	on	today	's	pro	football	scoreboard	.
we	've	seen	this	kind	of	thing	before	,	and	it	can	get	ugly	real	fast	.
fly	on	a	day	like	today	,	you	'll	think	you	died	and	went	to	heaven	.
you	mean	you	want	me	to	keep	a	secret	?	yes	.

what	?	you	ca	n't	abandon	me	!	there	's	a	madman	stalking	me	.
write	it	all	down	-	everywhere	you	went	,	everyone	you	saw	-	name	,	numbers	,	times	.
he	was	originally	from	a	savage	tribe	called	the	meestahs	,
last	time	he	did	n't	plan	,	yet	he	killed	them	all	.
but	it	's	not	long	before	we	wish	we	'd	never	woken	up	at	all	.
if	he	tries	to	come	back	,	arrest	him	for	trespassing	.
my	father	has	had	a	particularly	rough	couple	of	days	.
you	do	n't	expect	her	to	call	you	up	for	a	secret	rendezvous	,	do	you	?
coming	up	,	the	stars	that	made	a	lasting	impression	last	week	.
and	he	could	n't	go	through	with	his	plan	.	he	could	n't	kill	her	.
you	wanna	know	why	you	guys	are	all	here	protesting	?
i	had	a	really	nice	time	on	our	date	tonight	.

the	three	-	hour	time	difference	made	three	hours	late	for	cocktail	hour	.
he	does	n't	want	us	to	film	.	not	allowed	to	film	?
when	i	was	little	,	my	father	brought	me	in	here	.
my	wife	started	another	diet	today	.	then	why	are	you	so	hungry	?
well	,	should	n't	you	be	in	the	business	of	protecting	a	woman	whose	life	is	in	danger	?
i	think	we	should	trust	him	chief	.	oh	,	absolutely	,	chief	.	i	'm	with	99	on	that	one	.
it	's	on	my	list	of	things	.	right	after	we	get	tivo	.
hey	,	baby	girl	,	i	need	you	to	run	a	check	on	someone	for	me	.
do	you	know	who	in	the	hell	i	am	?	no	.
if	the	world	and	this	nation	was	run	by	gangsters	,
i	feel	i	've	taken	it	as	far	as	i	can	.
i	know	,	i	want	it	too	,	but	i	mean	-
it	's	just	he	's	so	passionate	about	so	many	different	things	.
we	published	the	thing	as	a	graphic	novel	,	our	first	collaboration	-
he	's	in	the	bathroom	.	i	have	him	in	the	bathroom	.
it	's	sparked	a	new	arms	race	.	led	by	this	man	.
you	were	mad	that	i	withheld	it	last	time	,	so	i	'm	saying	it	right	up	front	.
mom	,	he	is	not	interested	in	hearing	about	all	that
you	love	me	too	much	.	you	know	you	do	.	you	said	you	do	.

i	just	wanted	to	drop	off	some	food	for	you	guys	and	get	going	.
thank	you	.	-	and	you	're	wrong	about	hinduism	and	cows	.
i	knew	you	'd	need	them	for	tomorrow	and	i	was	on	my	way	.
i	mean	,	the	most	i	could	raise	last	time	was	1,000	.
there	was	a	surveillance	camera	put	in	right	where	this	trip	and	fall	happened	,	right	?
we	just	uploaded	the	files	to	the	internet	to	expose	the	lies
make	way	!	make	way	!	i	need	to	speak	to	the	fire	marshal	!
hey	,	one	at	a	time	.	let	me	take	a	look	too	.
if	it	is	not	in	your	possession	,	we	have	nothing	to	discuss	.
you	have	the	fires	and	you	have	the	floods	and	you	have	the	riots	...
i	have	a	ficus	at	home	that	's	been	shedding	its	leaves	.
and	you	think	glee	club	is	going	to	ange	that	?
meters	of	space	,	located	on	the	upper	levels	of	the	hotel	,	with	a	balcony	.
anything	you	say	can	and	will	be	used	against	you	in	a	court	of	law	.	do	you	understand	?

where	are	you	doing	?	-	well	,	this	is	dad	's	car	.
so	,	if	this	does	end	up	being	the	last	letter	...
and	it	would	blow	up	while	it	was	still	floating	down	to	the	bottom	.
i	know	that	we	were	supposed	look	at	costumes	today	.
i	'm	feeling	kind	of	nervous	about	this	routine	,	i	have	to	use	the	east	coast	style	.
but	he	finds	he	ca	n't	bring	himself	to	hurt	her	.
oh	,	i	do	n't	really	care	for	those	sort	of	games	,	if	you	wanna	know	the	truth	.
all	you	need	to	know	is	that	geralissimo	is	pure	evil	,	look	at	him	.
he	was	a	traitor	.	i	could	see	it	was	a	trap	,
i	can	run	things	900	to	1200	times	better	than	any	human	.
you	know	i	was	thinking	about	how	some	of	my	favorite	movies	wind	up	in	air	ducts	.
if	it	had	been	acid	in	that	pistol	and	not	ink	.
you	're	done	with	the	official	business	.	now	get	lost	on	your	scooter	.
a	while	back	did	n't	you	say	you	have	crab	dumplings	?
you	know	,	when	i	go	around	the	country	,	every	time	we	start	talking	about	people	's	hands	or	arms	,
you	are	the	reason	l	came	to	greece	.	all	right	,	come	tomorrow	.

how	am	l	ever	gon	na	get	out	of	debt	if	l	keep	letting	them	do	this	to	me	?
and	i	missed	and	hit	a	vein	in	her	forehead	.
clearly	i	was	stupid	enough	to	have	completely	bought	into	it	.
you	showed	me	that	i	could	be	so	much	more	,
and	if	you	do	n't	make	me	look	prettier	than	heidi	,

so	there	's	no	shortage	of	people	who	know	about	his	achilles	'	heel	.
but	not	a	dream	because	i	would	never	wake	up	,
i	have	a	family	.	i	'm	building	stables	across	the	road	.
if	they	knew	where	to	find	the	gent	that	was	after	them	,	before	he	found	them	.
but	we	wanted	to	remind	you	just	how	good	these	dancers	are	.
for	so	much	of	his	life	he	'd	been	a	builder	,	not	a	destroyer	,
i	'm	sorry	,	but	you	have	no	idea	what	you	're	talking	about	.
it	just	seems	like	everyone	thinks	of	me	as	this	cautious	person	,
and	kacey	sure	as	hell	does	not	need	me	in	her	life	,
before	we	go	a	little	bit	further	,	we	'd	like	to	introduce	ourselves	.
‘	cause	we	'd	spend	the	entire	night	together	before	putting	them	in	that	way
you	know	if	she	had	weird	ears	or	a	big	nose	,	we	'd	let	her	fix	that	,	right	?
from	now	on	i	'm	only	putting	my	faith	in	myself	.
she	's	trying	to	quit	smoking	.	did	i	mention	she	's	almost	a	nonsmoker	?
the	hell	with	that	,	bobby	.	make	him	more	of	a	martyr	?
even	before	that	,	i	was	already	a	little	bit	out	there	.
i	never	thought	i	d	die	in	any	place	but	hamburg	.
hey	,	i	wonder	if	you	can	see	my	apartment	from	up	here	.

i	know	you	're	upset	,	but	please	,	do	n't	let	my	mom	be	the	reason	.
so	now	i	need	to	get	demoted	back	to	the	drill	.
what	do	you	mean	,	rude	about	me	?
but	i	must	have	been	in	the	pantry	or	something
i	'm	in	a	world	full	of	white	people	,	and	every	day	they	remind	me	that	i	'm	black	.

i	was	just	going	to	drive	her	around	a	couple	hours	'	til	her	husband	played	some	song	.
i	'll	pick	him	up	from	school	tomorrow	and	i	'll	bring	him	back	to	you	.
i	'm	telling	you	,	man	,	i	do	n't	know	...	what	do	you	mean	you	're	not	?

i	mean	,	she	asked	me	to	not	date	you	at	homecoming
i	do	realize	that	there	may	be	bad	guys	out	there	too	.

your	boss	does	n't	know	about	this	little	field	trip	of	yours	,	does	he	?
i	know	it	's	greedy	and	wrathful	,	but	there	's	been	a	miscommunication	.
if	we	can	get	close	enough	to	use	them	,	you	bet	they	'll	stop	him	.
he	did	n't	tell	me	where	he	was	going	.	he	must	have	gone	out	.
where	's	holmes	?	i	think	he	went	up	to	his	room	.

now	,	as	a	result	of	his	actions	,	you	're	having	difficulty	trusting	your	judgment	about	this	young	man	.

i	'd	like	you	to	come	down	to	the	station	with	me	and	i	d	him	.
i	tried	to	be	all	like	cool	and	you	know	,	do	the	whole	footwork	.
yeah	-	ok	.	now	say	you	've	just	been	released	from	the	cells	.

but	you	put	a	nice	,	mild	turkey	chili	in	front	of	me	?
and	i	told	my	husband	that	i	was	already	on	my	way	home	.
if	no	one	objects	to	this	turn	of	the	wheel	being	for	the	lady	alone	.
true	,	but	what	does	carry	weight	is	that	an	investigation
however	,	hannan	wrote	that	she	believed	the	boy	scouts	had	already	started	to	create	coed	programs
but	i	think	they	also	got	away	with	blood	pressure	medication	.
about	not	being	able	to	sit	on	a	park	bench	in	this	country
on	our	way	back	up	,	i	told	her	:	let	's	die	together	,

but	with	no	air	around	him	,	it	was	a	silent	fall
i	'm	glad	you	came	back	.	i	wanted	to	talk	to	you	about	something	.
so	i	figured	it	did	just	be	easier	if	i	,	you	know	,	slipped	out	.
well	,	good	,	good	.	that	's	grand	.	it	's	about	fucking	time	too	.
which	since	they	know	he	's	a	vegetable	incapable	of	writing	do	-	re	-	mi	.

holding	a	gun	on	me	does	n't	carry	the	power	you	think	it	does	.
i	worked	my	tailbone	off	for	every	penny	i	ever	got	.
i	was	thrown	into	the	streets	with	my	two	kids	.
less	than	half	an	hour	out	,	we	hit	the	gulf	stream
i	can	wake	up	and	be	all	,	"	i	'm	in	the	mood	for	purple	”	,
a	smart	girl	like	you	?	of	course	you	can	.	do	you	want	to	try	?
but	you	built	me	stronger	every	year	!	i	had	to	!
you	want	to	kill	yourself	?	go	ahead	,	fine	your	call	.

except	forensics	now	say	the	body	was	definitely	moved	after	death	.
that	s	why	they	are	easily	conquered	over	by	mankind
a	few	hours	?	you	could	have	told	us	that	before	!
i	should	have	known	better	than	to	trust	a	pretty	boy	.
if	that	's	the	case	,	then	what	were	our	victims	doing	in	this	house	?
i	'd	like	to	free	that	boy	from	the	prison	of	obesity	.
we	're	stuck	in	this	awful	place	and	i	just	want	you	to	know	that	you	're	not	alone	.

but	let	's	just	pretend	for	a	minute	that	you	do	.
he	used	to	say	i	had	the	kiss	of	death	.
the	last	thing	i	want	to	do	is	about	the	roadblocks	going	up	.
yes	,	sure	.	we	have	different	kinds	of	sunglasses	.	prescription	-	lens	could	be	ordered	,	too	.	it	takes	just	a	few	days	.
and	i	know	you	all	need	me	,	but	i	'll	call	you	if	i	need	any	of	you	.
and	i	have	n't	found	a	way	to	deal	with	it	yet	.

i	can	even	take	you	to	the	gun	,	if	you	want	.	why	did	you	do	it	?
it	's	just	-	you	know	,	i	've	never	seen	him	like	this	before	.

and	i	would	've	given	my	own	money	,	of	course	,	sir	.
i	'm	gon	na	need	a	little	help	.	but	you	said	you	could	do	it	.

that	's	right	you	did	,	but	who	's	going	to	believe	you	?
i	've	been	forced	to	take	every	psych	evaluation	and	field	trial	the	bureau	can	think	of	.
a	:	well	,	shall	we	go	to	the	hotel	right	now	?	i	've	already	made	a	reservation	for	you	.
but	at	least	i	will	get	married1	what	about	you	?
you	can	keep	track	of	me	from	where	the	charges	come	from	...

i	mean	,	a	pink	lady	,	cajun	martini	,	maybe	a	simple	whiskey	soda	?
well	,	he	called	me	,	and	he	wanted	me	to	come	over	here
for	centuries	they	had	all	basically	gotten	along	as	that
was	n't	there	a	woman	in	the	er	that	was	about	to	give	birth

the	best	western	swan	castle	inn	is	the	perfect	location	to	hit	the	greens	while	you	're	away	on	business	.
do	you	think	maybe	i	have	esp	or	something	,	that	i	'm	gifted	?
i	love	how	she	calls	him	tommy	.	yeah	,	always	did	.

if	he	gets	thrown	from	that	horse	-	he	could	die	?
i	'm	sorry	.	i	just	have	a	hard	time	processing	what	you	're	telling	me	.
i	bet	you	talk	to	your	horse	.	you	understand	him	,	he	understands	you	.

did	i	screw	up	in	any	way	?	no	.	not	at	all	.
i	do	n't	want	them	to	say	i	love	that	song	.
i	mean	,	i	saw	the	connection	between	the	two	of	you	.
i	lit	a	lantern	and	went	in	search	of	sir	charles	.
i	mean	,	i	'm	sure	you	have	people	kissing	your	ass	24	hours	a	day	.
well	,	i	'm	sure	you	two	have	a	lot	to	talk	about	.
is	there	a	theory	on	how	we	might	get	out	of	this	...
first	tell	me	the	reason	behind	using	the	helicopter	to	steal	your	own	coffin	.
probably	best	to	take	the	rest	of	the	day	off	.
so	you	do	n't	care	that	people	are	starting	to	say	that
if	you	have	a	message	for	mark	darcy	,	speak	after	the	tone	.
what	if	i	never	get	to	operate	again	?	you	could	be	a	bartender	.
yes	,	she	often	goes	off	for	hours	at	a	time	,

our	staff	made	a	lot	of	mistakes	.	i	apologize	,	sir	.
there	is	a	saloon	collide	face	to	face	with	a	truck
you	let	her	know	that	if	she	wo	n't	satisfy	your	needs	,
i	have	selected	you	for	a	most	important	assignment	.
but	i	,	i	think	i	hate	them	even	more	than	you	do	.	here	.

and	all	of	a	sudden	one	night	he	stops	watching
we	're	starving	.	now	,	there	has	to	be	something	that	we	can	do	.
all	this	is	from	an	old	speech	you	made	at	the	policemen	's	ball	.
is	that	the	life	you	propose	for	my	only	child	-
i	could	only	think	in	a	way	i	've	thought	all	my	life	.
you	will	post	it	with	the	media	and	you	will	tack	up
thank	god	.	now	,	shoot	him	before	i	have	to	shoot	myself	.
oh	,	well	,	great	.	because	i	mean	we	have	to	work	together	,
enough	advantage	for	him	to	chance	a	draw	against	me	.
actually	,	74	human	hearts	beat	inside	no	.10	downing	street
wait	,	what	did	he	say	when	he	found	out	that	you	were	you	?
do	n't	worry	.	go	out	there	,	put	the	machine	behind	him	.
then	you	know	if	anyone	deserves	to	die	,	it	's	him	.
a	complimentary	full	breakfast	comes	with	steaming	hot	waffles	,	fresh	fruits	,	sweet	pastries	,	cereal	,	yogurt	,	and	100	%	arabica	coffee	.

oh	.	sir	,	do	you	think	i	can	make	a	copy	of	this	to	put	into	my	article	?
but	they	did	run	in	similar	circles	.	how	do	you	mean	?
my	wife	caught	me	looking	at	too	much	po	-
i	do	n't	know	about	that	.	that	tin	can	of	mine	has	155	brake	horse	power
honey	.	guess	what	happened	?	i	go	downstairs	to	get	your	breakfast	.
look	,	it	's	not	like	i	can	throw	on	a	bikini
oh	,	i	do	n't	think	that	's	true	.	i	think	he	pinched	it	.
what	,	you	expect	me	to	pay	you	for	your	testimony	?
i	do	n't	need	to	talk	to	anyone	about	it	,	okay	?
time	-	out	on	the	field	now	,	and	these	fans	are	not	happy	.
i	dare	you	put	that	lasso	of	truth	around	you	.
yeah	,	i	do	indeed	.	what	's	with	the	funny	look	?
and	i	like	that	you	're	engaging	with	the	audience	more	.

so	she	can	change	appearance	at	will	?	yeah	,	and	it	gives	her	strength	.

adjacent	to	pizza	hut	,	buffet	,	american	,	open	for	:	lunch	,	dinner	,	delivery	available	11:00	a.m.	-	10:00	p.m.
so	i	give	him	a	knife	to	take	home	and	practice	with	.
just	wanted	to	see	what	kind	of	tests	you	're	doing	on	your	own	every	night	.
i	know	you	do	,	but	i	'm	here	to	tell	you	the	bad	news	.
the	simpleton	study	is	also	useless	and	i	am	a	simpleton
i	've	got	a	friend	in	the	justice	department	.	i	can	dial	direct	.
follow	brussels	ring	,	exit	10	,	then	follow	basilique	and	take	exit	centre	.
but	in	my	circumstances	as	a	lecturer	and	a	married	man	.
i	took	the	gun	out	of	the	plastic	bag	.	guilty	!
i	was	on	my	way	down	to	see	.	do	you	care	to	join	us	?
can	we	please	focus	on	my	missing	brother	right	now	?
but	if	any	guy	who	really	was	shy	dared	talk	to	you	.
because	of	her	,	i	want	to	finish	this	out	to	the	end	.
oh	,	well	it	's	ruined	now	,	is	n't	it	,	you	heartless	bastard	!
last	week	i	tried	to	get	a	job	in	my	old	trade	.
bobby	's	my	record	producer	.	we	must	drop	by	the	studio	.
i	knew	we	were	up	for	review	,	and	i	wanted	to	show	you	what	we	could	do	.
you	gon	na	make	action	to	get	action	.	is	n't	that	right	,	sweetheart	?
i	mean	,	the	bottle	was	with	everything	else	.	who	else	had	access	to	it	?
i	am	asking	you	to	help	me	secure	my	son	's	future	...
if	you	're	only	going	to	cover	half	the	education	budget	?
yes	,	ray	,	strangers	.	i	'd	like	to	try	strangers	for	a	change	.
if	you	want	to	shove	that	back	down	your	throat	.
the	canopy	's	open	,	of	course	,	and	so	then	i	bail	out	...
how	much	longer	are	we	gon	na	have	to	do	this	?
by	all	accounts	,	your	son	looks	16	and	not	24	,	just	as	you	look	35	and	not	43	.
am	i	allowed	to	be	up	here	?	well	,	sure	.	why	not	?
why	do	n't	you	just	spread	your	wings	a	wee	bit	?
but	you	are	a	girl	-	loving	,	full	-	on	lesbian	!
that	sent	a	modern	day	metal	nero	to	attack	you	.
there	were	many	men	among	us	over	70	years	of	age	.
oh	,	well	,	then	,	this	should	be	named	after	the	greatest	of	all	.
why	do	n't	you	move	over	and	let	me	show	you	that	trick	for	creating	a	subcutaneous	pocket	?
is	that	you	're	in	no	position	to	be	making	any	kind	of	deals	,
so	you	're	worried	...	not	because	you	will	be	in	a	house	full	of	vampires	but	...
hey	,	jack	,	fill	'em	up	,	this	one	is	on	me	,
her	looks	at	me	from	the	corner	of	her	eyes	.

hi	.	who	do	i	speak	to	who
you	just	had	with	jessica	and	lucille	that	you	conveniently	left	me	out	of	.
i	hope	you	enjoy	your	trip	,	mr	.	wallace	.	thank	you	.
but	there	's	still	a	lot	of	work	to	be	done	.
which	we	have	seen	tonight	and	actually	making	it	believable
you	guys	,	i	go	to	see	this	so	-	called	black	film	the	other	day	.
but	i	just	ca	n't	see	sewing	her	back	up	.	it	just	feels	wrong	.
i	just	want	to	call	home	and	tell	him	that	i	'm	okay	.
i	said	to	my	uncles	that	one	.	he	's	cute	.	he	's	on	his	way	up	.	let	me	at	him	.
if	it	were	the	other	way	around	,	there	is	nothing	you	could	put	on	a	list	...
i	do	n't	make	crazy	.	i	just	crank	up	what	's	already	there	.
i	'm	going	to	get	your	picture	,	and	you	're	going	to	participate	in	my	program	.
we	do	what	we	do	to	get	the	job	done	.
there	's	gon	na	be	some	more	money	coming	in	soon	.	is	that	okay	?
you	've	proven	yourself	a	solid	lawyer	and	a	capable	leader	,
i	'm	sorry	both	for	what	i	'm	about	to	tell	you
do	you	need	me	to	make	you	a	mix	tape	?
i	'll	take	it	when	i	go	courting	.	there	are	empty	pages	in	it	.
we	'll	be	able	to	pull	him	out	of	the	induced	coma	soon	.
i	'm	sure	you	guys	have	other	things	in	common	,	right	?
i	thought	mother	/	daughter	time	would	be	a	good	thing	.
this	is	a	car	for	making	your	hair	stand	on	end
you	need	to	start	thinking	more	positively	.	we	need	to	celebrate	.
an	outdoor	terrace	will	be	open	during	the	summer	season	.
hoping	that	somebody	will	want	you	when	it	's	you	who	needs	to	figure	out
oh	,	god	,	i	'm	sorry	.	before	i	knew	it	was	you	,
yeah	.	chris	was	a	freshman	when	he	was	a	senior	.
drop	the	bottle	top	!	drop	it	!	drop	that	thing	,	blanche	!
2	mile(s	)	from	chilis	,	full	service	,	american	,	open	for	:	lunch	,	dinner
ah	,	behavior	that	conflicts	with	one	of	the	fundamental	tenets
we	did	not	stand	a	chance	against	you	if	we	got	into	firing	.
she	know	what	she	's	doing	with	them	little	ass	shorts	on	.
three	of	you	did	not	and	will	be	put	up	for	the	vote	.
just	makes	you	want	to	cry	,	looking	at	all	of	these	.
at	that	point	,	you	know	,	nancy	and	freddy	's	relationship	always	had	a	sexual
besides	,	what	kind	of	man	does	n't	help	his	ex	-	wife	make	bail	?
we	caught	a	ride	to	stonybrook	,	but	we	were	late	.
i	uh	,	the	secretary	told	me	to	come	in	.	i	'm	detective	harrison	,	conway	police	.
actually	,	no	.	there	's	nothing	more	we	can	do	for	him	as	long	as	we	stay	here	.
another	tale	.	as	a	matter	of	fact	,	i	'm	working	on	one	at	the	moment	.
a	crucial	link	between	the	protesters	and	the	outside	world	.
he	does	n't	think	about	others	.	he	goes	looking	for	danger	.
if	he	were	just	the	defendant	,	you	could	put	him	in	another	room	.	they	both	watch	it	on	tv	.
i	guess	i	'll	just	take	a	cab	,	then	.
and	if	you	like	what	i	do	,	then	,	uh	,	you	give	me	a	little
i	do	n't	want	you	to	think	that	all	americans	are	like	that	.
i	almost	forgot	.	she	told	me	to	chew	you	out	.
i	do	n't	understand	a	lot	of	what	you	've	been	telling	me	.
i	'll	say	i	did	n't	find	you	tonight	if	you	let	me	fight	too	,	sir	.
if	i	want	to	operate	here	,	i	'm	gon	na	have	to	kick	up	.
but	i	was	a	kid	when	i	had	him	,	practically	.
i	do	not	care	what	your	son	may	or	may	not	have	done	wrong	.
i	had	a	great	time	at	the	last	one	.	i	was	in	charge	of	the	music	.
and	what	do	you	suggest	i	do	with	this	information	?
listen	to	me	carefully	and	do	exactly	as	i	tell	you	.
to	other	divisions	and	counting	them	as	clearance	on	paper	.
i	know	you	think	that	i	got	that	girl	killed	.
thought	i	'd	make	a	little	dinner	like	we	do	back	home	.
are	you	gon	na	charge	him	with	the	crime	or	not	?
we	played	long	into	the	night	,	eventually	making	it	to	the	dreaded	...
i	'm	so	sick	of	this	acting	thing	,	it	's	just	not	working	out	.
he	's	made	more	than	a	dozen	calls	from	a	secure	line	in	his	home	.
we	welcome	medical	patients	,	health	care	professionals	and	others	who	choose	our	hotel	in	vidor	,	tx	.
i	've	scanned	the	entire	casino	.	i	ca	n't	find	who	he	's	looking	at	.
point	is	,	i	was	so	worried	about	watching	your	every	move
that	's	why	they	call	it	formula	racing.it	's	about	the	formula	.
thought	he	had	a	nice	crowd	of	vaqueros	one	day	,
so	if	you	ca	n't	bear	the	thought	of	being	trapped	alone
but	,	um	,	it	will	force	me	to	become	acquaintances	with	people	i	consider	.
i	knew	that	buffoon	of	yours	could	n't	be	the	wizard	.
i	could	only	change	one	more	time	,	and	i	was	saving	it	for	this	.
what	are	you	asking	me	?	if	it	's	moral	?	i	do	n't	know	.
the	one	who	used	to	mellow	you	out	with	his	wacky	weed	.
are	fiber	-	reinforced	polymers	and	hydrocarbon	secretion	of	coniferous	trees	.
i	think	i	have	a	dead	researcher	who	was	juicing	on	something	.
with	a	small	boy	,	with	no	money	and	no	regular	job	.
would	you	like	me	to	bring	you	some	arm	extenders	with	that	?
if	you	want	to	sell	her	,	you	might	as	well	go	to	the	hospital	and	pull	the	plug	.
he`s	been	after	me	for	years	,	but	i	outsmart	him	every	time	.
sweet	!	i	got	ta	call	my	mom	to	let	her	know	to	feed	my	cats	this	weekend	.
sir	,	i	swear	he	takes	a	whole	bunch	of	these	every	day	.	i	swear	i	'm	not	lying	.	judge	,	please	.
but	we	still	need	to	make	sure	there	are	n't	any	tilt	vibration	switches	before	we	move	anything	.
but	what	it	's	going	to	mean	is	up	to	you	.
you	think	his	dad'll	put	him	back	on	the	team	?
i	'm	sorry	for	getting	on	you	about	that	whole	matthews	thing	.
many	men	think	they	are	going	to	die	,	brother	.	a	few	of	us	know	it	.
i	have	to	fucking	answer	to	her	skinny	ass	every	day	.
she	had	that	look	in	her	eye	that	maybe	he	did	it	.
sometimes	they	describe	it	as	almost	as	though	something	is	inside	there	,
and	i	do	n't	wanna	get	shot	today	,	so	great	hustle	,	great	practice	.
wanted	to	check	out	the	competition	.	how	are	the	dogs	?
you	did	n't	kick	me	in	the	ass	.	i	did	n't	feel	anything	.
you	need	to	stop	the	bleeding	!	-	what	are	you	doing	here	?
uh	,	well	,	we	're	all	aware	of	the	fact	that	wealthy	men	pay	for	sex	.
what	's	the	point	?	it	all	gets	trampled	in	the	end	.
do	n't	worry	about	it	.	you	guys	will	be	home	for	lunch	.
featuring	one	separate	bedroom	with	king	size	bed	,	cozy	chair	and	42	-	inch	tv	.
we	'll	just	take	him	away	with	us	,	back	to	our	planet	,
i	was	like	do	n't	want	to	hear	that	.
would	you	believe	me	if	i	told	you	that	this	hurricane
you	ride	along	with	the	expanding	light	waves	from	that
she	's	one	of	these	low	talkers	.	he	's	a	high	talker	.
anyway	,	i	know	that	if	i	fall	flat	on	my	face	,	i	have	you	to	come	home	to	.
do	n't	worry	,	you	can	pay	me	when	it	's	a	hit	.
ah	,	you	have	?	yeah	,	about	some	girl	i	supposedly	mistreated	.
before	i	came	siam	was	just	that	little	white	spot	to	me	.
once	she	figures	out	that	player	1	is	going	to	choose	down	.
well	,	i	apologize	for	the	extreme	security	,	but	i	think	you	'll	appreciate
it	's	like	an	orange	made	love	to	a	plum	.	would	you	like	some	?
all	you	have	to	do	is	run	it	under	the	hot	water	tap	.
yeah	,	i	think	she	also	might	be	a	little	miffed	with	me	.
let	's	get	him	to	the	m.	e.	's	office	.	somebody	get	a	gurney	.
i	mean	,	you	were	there	,	at	the	hotel	you	saw	the	world	.
well	,	it	's	a	slanted	perspective	to	see	the	extraordinary	through	ordinary	eyes	.
henceforth	,	learn	to	respect	the	beauty	of	a	woman	,	understand	?
our	switchboard	at	the	firm	was	blocked	,	the	switchboard	at	bank	street	was	blocked	.
i	did	n't	think	i	was	supposed	to	return	to	the	scene	of	the	crime	.
no	,	it	's	very	good	.	they	have	to	argue	to	see	who	wins	.
and	i	understand	my	responsibility	in	what	i	've	done	wrong	here	.
using	the	free	wi	-	fi	,	you	can	immediately	access	the	internet	.
this	is	not	where	i	expected	to	spend	my	last	night	in	phoenix	.

on	the	ground	,	the	conquests	continued	,	driven	,	as	ever	by	the	lust	for	gold
i	never	know	whether	i	'm	looking	at	a	victim	or	perpetrator	.
come	on	.	he	's	got	a	chance	to	be	happy	now	-
i	would	n't	put	her	life	in	your	hands	or	anyone	else	's	.
a	lot	of	people	think	i	'm	suspicious	,	especially	when	i	stand	on	street	corners	.
one	microwave	popcorn	and	your	choice	of	one	dvd	movie	from	our	library	.
i	was	hungry	from	my	long	journey	and	i	could	n't	help	myself	.
the	other	guys	would	just	stuff	a	dirty	rag	in	my	mouth	,	but	not	this	guy	.
i	know	somebody	's	there	,	i	can	hear	you	breathing	.
yeah	,	you	need	to	apologize	...	not	to	me	,	but	to	her	.
i	mean	to	be	two	people	who	occupy	the	same	body	,
they	're	still	cracking	down	on	the	opposition	and	they	're	not	showing	any	signs	of	letting	up	.
his	decisions	do	n't	appear	to	be	in	the	best	interests	of	haiti	.
with	all	the	cameras	and	intercoms	turned	off	,	i	did	n't	notice	anything	.
he	shot	her	!	he	shot	her	!	she	ca	n't	move	,	sir	.	she	needs	help	.
soon	two	of	my	brothers	are	leaving	to	serve	their	country	.
so	,	i	gets	to	thinking	maybe	i	can	find	out	a	few	more	winners	.
it	is	most	likely	that	in	many	places	we	would	see	martial	law	break	out	.
what	if	they	've	already	moved	her	from	the	beach	house	?
hopefully	we	'll	be	able	to	get	the	last	minute	practice	in	before	the	worlds	.

i	do	n't	want	the	goon	squad	rolling	in	and	stealing	our	shot	,	you	know	?
if	you	'd	kept	your	legs	together	in	the	first	place
i	do	n't	know	what	i	would	have	done	if	something	was	the	matter	with	you	.	well	...
all	i	've	got	at	home	is	one	pony	and	two	dogs	and	four	cats	and	six	bunny	rabbits	...
have	you	ever	even	talked	to	her	?	no	,	i	'm	working	on	that	.
i	know	.	i	'm	just	doing	some	final	revisions	to	this	piece	on	euthanasia	.

i	've	had	the	carrot	,	now	i	get	the	stick	?	that	's	not	my	style	.
so	i	left	a	message	with	the	info	and	my	cell	number	.

i	was	getting	sick	and	tired	of	patching	and	re	patching	the	old	ones	.
and	he	hand	-	wrote	a	bunch	of	phony	quotes
you	just	have	to	stay	calm	,	and	they	will	contact	you	.
in	fact	,	what	you	did	n't	know	,	and	what	i	did	n't	know	,
i	love	soccer	more	than	anything	else	in	the	world	,
i	'll	pick	your	parents	up	from	the	airport	in	the	morning	.
being	the	bottom	of	the	armed	fed	food	chain	,	and	not	married	.
but	i	thought	we	could	use	some	time	to	talk	.
that	looks	like	the	pow	camp	from	out	the	script	,	yo	.
at	the	stop	,	turn	right	;	the	best	western	plus	moncton	will	be	on	the	left	.
we	have	also	included	a	coffee	maker	and	individual	ac	and	heater	.
and	i	've	uploaded	your	file	,	so	he	's	got	a	record	.
a.	j.	,	you	're	at	600	feet	.	your	pipe	is	long	.	let	's	back	the	r.p.m	.	s	down	to	8,000	.
even	put	together	,	these	girls	are	n't	as	old	as	your	ex	-	wife	.
award	winning	hotel	,	completely	renovated	in	2011	,	free	full	breakfast	,	indoor	pool
all	i	have	to	do	is	drink	maple	syrup	,	lemon	juice	,	cayenne	pepper	,	and	water
well	,	then	you	are	going	to	stand	there	all	day	.
you	honestly	expect	me	to	get	in	that	car	with	you	?
oh	,	what	a	pity	.	in	another	moment	,	you	might	have	been	strangling	each	other	.
fucking	dirty	whores	!	-	fuck	off	man	,	back	the	fuck	off	.
there	's	a	lot	of	blood	,	but	it	did	n't	penetrate	the	gale	.
you	have	to	be	with	troops	to	understand	the	adrenaline	.
no	,	it	means	i	was	born	in	june	.	ah	,
mom	always	wants	you	to	talk	more	.	do	n't	change	the	subject	.
come	on	.	let	's	go	.	what	is	wrong	with	you	,	man	?
two	little	girls	asked	me	,	why	was	daddy	blown	up	?
cause	i	've	been	loving	you	for	such	a	long	time	,	girl
it	's	the	perfect	getaway	for	nature	lovers	,	but	if	modern	convenience	is	your	priority	you	're	in	luck	.
he	really	swings	his	weight	-
where	am	i	going	?	to	mingle	with	the	best	and	brightest	.
she	's	wanted	a	sit	-	down	since	you	sequestered	her	from	bud	's	white	house	.
suddenly	removed	from	the	face	of	the	earth	two	weeks	after	.
i	came	off	as	a	dancer	who	was	trying	to	sing	.
i	bet	your	father	was	still	mickey	sullivan	until	the	end	.
why	would	you	expect	it	to	have	such	a	high	price	?
first	bus	to	berlin	does	n't	leave	till	tomorrow	.	what	do	you	wanna	do	?
basically	every	last	dime	we	had	to	our	name	gone	.
oh	,	do	n't	worry	.	we	shall	have	a	most	lovely	time	.
his	grades	began	to	slip	,	so	i	took	the	game	away	.
when	i	pulled	you	out	,	i	looked	at	your	face	.
uh	,	yeah	,	so	you	were	here	yesterday	during	the	shooting	.
did	i	ever	tell	you	that	my	father	played	for	the	denver	broncos	?
if	anyone	has	seen	her	,	please	call	the	police	right	away	.
all	right	,	well	,	i	got	ta	go	find	carter	and	morris	.
yes	,	this	is	mr	edwards	,	and	this	...	how	are	you	?
these	terrorists	have	possession	of	a	military	-	grade	nerve	agent	.
i	do	n't	really	see	any	other	reason	for	you	to	be	standing	'	round	here	talking	to	me	.
boy	,	mom	must	be	worried	sick	about	me	right	now	.
if	you	want	to	punish	me	for	taking	a	risk	,	then	i	encourage	you	to	do	that	,
save	for	a	twisted	ankle	running	the	boston	marathon	last	year	.
i	'll	kill	you	.	come	back	is	one	of	these	things	.
if	you	keep	this	child	,	are	you	really	ready	?	yeah	.
yes	,	but	anyone	who	knows	anything	about	the	dynamics	of	bacterial	growth	knows
i	just	had	to	leave	a	very	busy	day	at	work	to	get	you	out	of	school	.
you	know	who	we	are	.	you	know	what	we	do	.
you	're	going	to	take	an	exam	on	all	the	coursework	.
i	do	n't	care	how	bad	things	are	i	will	never	go	back	to	dallas	.
and	i	thought	that	it	was	kind	of	a	fun	way	of	getting	what	i	want	.
grab	the	little	guys	!	toss	them	up	!	let	's	go	!	go	,	go	,	go	!	go	!
and	how	old	are	you	,	31	?	you	still	live	at	home	.
which	was	that	this	process	could	be	controlled	by	heat	.
all	right	,	you	got	him	!	you	got	him	!	put	that	shit	away	,	man	.	come	on	.
he	wanted	me	to	give	up	names	and	addresses	for	the	guys	i	work	with	the	top	guys	.
what	time	is	it	?	i	thought	they	would	be	here	by	now	.
she	's	always	complaining	about	how	i	'm	blowing	out	the	power	and	all	that	.
i	'm	at	this	place	.	i	'm	stuck	here	for	the	night	.
of	course	!	your	ears	must	be	tiny	.	i	need	to	speak	up	.
yeah	,	i	think	you	should	probably	tell	me	everything	,	starting	at	the	beginning	.
he	's	even	worn	your	yellow	shirt	;	he	's	looking	really	cute	.
we	acted	based	on	that	proof	and	we	treated	her	.
what	did	i	do	?	do	n't	ask	me	!	we	had	a	date	!
these	boards	are	gon	na	expand	and	rub	against	each	other	.
will	you	see	that	he	gets	this	.	tell	him	it	's	yours	.
she	's	already	agreed	to	turn	over	the	phoney	patent	documents	,
i	do	n't	want	you	to	say	anything	you	do	n't	mean	.
i	would	never	let	my	sister	travel	alone	with	a	man	.
if	they	have	n't	been	spotted	yet	,	they	've	broken	the	perimeter	.
julia	in	front	of	her	stove	has	the	same	fascination	for	me
from	:	the	west	.	take	interstate	10	east	to	the	new	orleans	business	district	.
why	would	you	care	?	she	's	the	woman	who	kills	you	.
sure	they	would	,	if	you	get	them	in	the	mood	.
and	those	backwards	connections	are	of	comparable	size	to	the	forward	one	.
my	mom	says	i	'm	like	her	and	do	n't	have	good	taste	in	men	.
kevin	costner	and	robert	de	niro	.	-	what	was	it	called	?
the	good	money	's	on	you	making	commander	in	three	years	.
hey	,	if	you	want	the	castle	,	it	s	this	a	way
i	'm	gon	na	give	you	a	few	seconds	before	i	come	.
do	you	know	the	first	time	we	ever	talked	to	each	other	?
and	,	you	know	if	you	're	really	set	on	being	that	supermodel	,
i	'm	auditioning	because	i	've	waited	all	my	life	for	an	experience	like	this	.
i	know	,	we	are	,	dude	.	i	'm	gon	na	take	you	out	,	bro	.	we	're	gon	na	get	this	town	started	.
look	,	open	the	damn	door	!	that	's	it	.	that	is	it	.
you	'll	just	explain	to	him	that	you	're	not	a	communist	.
if	only	he	had	five	or	six	thousand	a	year	,
well	,	i	'm	more	than	just	the	witness	at	the	pool	party	.
i	just	sent	you	the	chemical	breakdown	from	our	lab	.
if	i	had	n't	gotten	out	of	there	last	night	-
for	a	minute	there	i	actually	thought	maybe	this	could	happen	for	me	.
two	dozen	and	even	a	chicken	,	you	rascal	.	you	will	pay	for	them	,	you	or	your	father	.
i	can	not	go	to	my	boss	with	a	$	158	damage	waiver	,	captain	.
why	the	hell	should	i	do	you	a	favor	,	huh	?
i	dropped	him	off	at	his	place	at	around	8:30	.
we	can	insert	a	small	tube	in	the	baby	's	bladder
if	you	take	them	out	,	my	new	holes	will	close	.
a	reporter	like	you	should	fight	to	tell	the	truth	!
unplug	the	damn	thing	.	let	's	get	the	frank	out	of	here	.
maybe	luke	would	be	willing	to	settle	down	and	buy	the	station	sooner	.
her	voice	,	her	hair	,	her	breathing	...	as	if	she	were	fainting	.
i	'm	gon	na	go	find	out	how	she	read	that	spell	.	what	are	you	going	to	do	?
hey	,	honey	,	you	've	got	to	really	...	you	should	get	ready	,	okay	?
downstairs	,	i	use	what	you	tell	me	to	make	sure	you	function	properly	.
so	probably	up	until	1984	or	'	80	...	no	,	'	86	or	'	87	.
and	i	wanted	her	to	know	that	you	and	i	were	the	same	in	our	feelings	.
to	seduce	them	,	and	get	them	to	run	around	with	you	.
hey	,	hey	,	hey	!	i	heard	my	favorite	uncle	was	here	,	huh	?	come	on	!
my	step	-	dad	,	and	hijacking	my	family	and	taking	them
i	know	a	little	about	a	lot	.	you	seem	to	know	a	lot	about	this	.
if	you	did	not	sign	your	gi	life	insurance	policy	.
it	's	amazing	that	no	one	was	hurt	in	the	explosion	.
but	i	'm	not	gon	na	tell	him	because	it	's	a	surprise	.
but	first	,	i	need	to	get	rid	of	his	bodyguard	.
is	there	any	chance	that	this	group	is	part	of	the	u.s	.	government	?
just	saying	i	've	seen	men	have	their	fingernails	pulled	off
there	's	far	more	alphas	wave	your	hands	the	beta	's	okay	.
if	i	could	have	some	material	.	you	are	many	things	.
i	took	you	in	when	all	of	our	old	friends	had	turned	their	backs	on	you	.
the	stars	will	wheel	forth	from	their	daytime	hiding	places	.
you	did	tell	them	he	attacked	you	?	oh	,	what	i	would	give
part	of	the	footage	i	captured	when	i	was	leaving	your	home	included	this	:
just	in	case	you	're	thinking	of	making	a	life	change	.
he	holed	up	and	turned	his	back	on	the	rest	of	the	world	for	a	long	time	.
it	teaches	you	that	whatever	you	do	with	your	life	...
i	can	get	satellite	and	comm	back	up	.	i	just	need	to	finish	tapping	into	that	trunk	line	.
i	've	been	sick	before	,	i	've	just	never	puked	.	swear	on	my	mother	's	grave	.
what	do	i	do	?	they	'll	tell	you	what	to	do	.
god	,	it	feels	good	to	paint	this	a	new	color	.
honey	,	we	are	the	only	girlfriends	.	what	brand	do	you	use	for	sanitary	napkins	?
i	'm	designing	a	line	of	retro	-	chic	sleepwear	and	lingerie	and	i.
the	reason	i	do	n't	want	to	play	a	strictly	dominated	strategy	is	,
like	each	puff	is	like	a	passing	moment	,	a	passing	thought	.
and	i	stopped	at	the	store	on	my	way	home	.
get	the	rv	in	shape	-	tune	up	,	oil	change	,	brake	lights	,	and	whatnot	.
well	,	lets	get	back	into	the	party	and	see	what	everybody	's	doing	!
stand	up	tall	.	-	all	right	.	i	had	enough	of	this	.
what	did	you	say	?	-	that	i	have	come	to	give	the	money	.
why	?	you	could	n't	wait	to	get	her	married	?	in	too	much	of	a	hurry	..
all	our	would	as	and	could	as	and	should	as	.
you	know	,	my	instinct	is	that	you	should	have	your	own	business	.
had	pumpkin	ravioli	on	the	menu	last	night	-	a	special	.
gift	basket	with	wine	,	bubble	bath	,	mood	candle	and	chocolates	.
yeah	,	well	,	at	least	i	'm	not	a	second	-	rate	comedian	,	zora	.
we	need	to	secure	her	in	the	first	floor	lockdown	.
but	i	fear	it	will	be	longer	than	either	of	us	have	imagined	.
man	,	i	loved	that	ride	.	that	rusted	out	old	thing	?
i	was	with	six	friends	all	night	.	you	know	that	.	you	talked	to	them	.
why	do	n't	you	just	fast	-	forward	it	to	the	day	of	the	explosion	?
i	do	n't	care	what	you	do	for	your	last	hurrah	,	just	...
what	a	tiny	plane	.	we	have	a	smaller	one	but	ca	n't	find	it	.
he	's	not	going	to	.	i	have	n't	given	him	anything	to	print	.
he	gave	it	to	that	nazi	tiger	right	in	the	belly	!
if	you	follow	me	you	will	get	a	tight	slap	.
last	year	when	the	engines	failed	on	the	passenger	jet	i	was	flying	,
i	should	have	snuck	a	scalpel	into	one	of	our	interviews	and	cut	your	throat	myself	.
military	-	issue	combat	boots	.	five	sets	all	leading	in	here	,	less	than	an	hour	old	.
most	people	think	distracting	a	group	of	guys	is	best	done	by	a	beautiful	woman	.
why	would	i	spy	on	the	doll	...	i	do	n't	care	why	.
just	the	history	with	him	is	so	terrible	,	and	i	just	-
i	mean	,	they	're	gon	na	be	engaged	for	like	what	?	a	year	?
uh	,	come	on	in	.	i	'm	sorry	to	bother	you	.
claire	did	nothing	to	you	.	why	'd	you	go	after	her	?
why	did	n't	you	stop	yourself	?	why	did	n't	you	say	"	stop	it	"	?
i	see	.	so	after	all	this	time	in	your	service	,
and	do	someone	because	you	're	the	right	-	hand	man	.

i	'm	going	to	use	it	to	power	the	blastosaurus	.	-	it	's	too	risky	!
nuke	the	city	if	there	's	any	sign	of	a	foothold	situation	.
rather	than	try	to	fake	my	way	through	it	,	i	stood	there	like	a	statue	.
well	,	that	sounds	like	a	lot	of	fun	.	yes	,	and	...
well	,	if	they	have	,	my	happiness	makes	no	deference	to	them	.
i	've	gone	to	visit	our	friends	from	africa	and	recover	our	rubies	.
one	prostitute	,	and	i	did	n't	even	know	she	was	a	prostitute	until	after	.
i	got	a	gift	for	you	so	far	i	like	it
how	so	much	co	got	pumped	into	the	vehicle	's	cabin	.
to	reach	the	warm	currents	,	we	must	do	like	the	geese
and	i	know	you	told	me	there	's	other	people	there	,
but	i	never	let	them	talk	.	not	for	more	than	two	seconds	.
i	thought	it	was	weird	that	you	said	you	thought	of	her	like	a	little	brother	.
would	you	like	to	know	how	much	he	paid	for	me	?	three	hundred	...	american	.
uh	,	first	,	i	-	i	,	uh	,	would	like	to	,	uh	,	apologize	...
and	take	also	of	the	tree	of	life	,	and	eat	,	and	live	forever
that	means	that	i	think	someone	has	a	crush	on	someone	,
you	are	sitting	there	because	you	are	the	only	possible	reason	.
you	are	just	stirring	up	lies	and	getting	folks	agitated	.
nothing	.	you	can	just	do	it	about	a	quadrillion	times	as	fast	.
i	feel	like	we	're	on	the	wrong	side	of	the	argument	here	.
i	love	it	.	i	am	gon	na	put	it	up	on	my	wall	at	brown
he	was	asleep	when	i	got	home	and	when	i	woke	up	,	he	was	gone	.
i	know	i	ca	n't	swim	,	but	i	have	to	try	!
he	-	he	-	he	started	feeling	bad	,	and	i	-	i	-	he	-	he	-
i	tell	you	what	we	should	dry	them	up	right	now	.
that	all	of	time	existed	at	once	:	past	,	present	,	future	.
he	does	n't	stand	behind	my	back	since	i	already	know	,
you	know	,	i	surprised	you	two	never	went	for	it	.
what	are	you	lookin	'	at	you	sons	-	of	-	bitches	?
join	us	every	morning	for	complimentary	buffet	breakfast	–	hmmm	...	make	your	own	waffles	!
well	,	who	i	am	has	nothing	to	do	with	one	character	i	played
get	away	from	me	or	i	'm	going	to	call	security	.
price	,	utah	is	home	to	the	gorgeous	usu	campus	as	well	as	the	usu	eastern	prehistoric	museum	.
how	the	hell	did	i	let	things	go	this	far	?
what	if	i	had	something	that	could	help	you	find	who	did	this	?
you	should	n't	have	cut	my	sex	scene	after	all	!
murder	?	-	the	monkeys	have	killed	their	orderly	and	escaped	.
i	'm	heading	north	through	niobrara	to	wyoming	to	kill	two	no	-	good	cowboys	.
you	'll	have	to	go	down	the	road	about	a	half	mile	.	you	'll	see	a	sign	.
if	we	're	gon	na	get	out	of	here	alive	,	and	i	have	one	.
by	the	way	,	it	did	not	solve	our	problem	in	bed	.
i	'm	looking	to	add	a	local	amateur	to	the	field	.
is	what	separates	the	outside	world	from	our	internal	bodies	.
and	if	not	,	she	'll	explode	and	kill	both	of	you	.	so	one	problem	solves	another	.
two	women	who	should	never	have	existed	in	the	first	place	.
now	i	take	my	place	above	you	all	.	get	ready	.
young	man	,	now	that	you	're	a	respected	author	,	have	you	met	any	famous	people	?
he	's	coming	ug	right	on	our	ass	.	what	the	fuck	is	in	that	thing	?
read	the	morning	paper	or	cuddle	up	to	novel	beside	our	fireplace	in	a	warm	setting	.
yes	,	you	said	that	you	'd	been	staying	there	for	a	while	,	and	you	were	helping	people	with	strange	troubles	.
i	do	n't	want	to	be	singing	as	you	're	walking	out	!
other	one	's	personal	effects	-	what	the	corporals	had	on	them	.
he	's	right	!	making	maps	into	hats	,	hanging	upside	-	down	;
is	there	a	quiet	place	she	can	sit	down	for	a	bit	?
you	know	what	?	that	thing	you	say	,	it	's	not	as	cute	any	more	.
if	they	crossed	it	with	holder	,	the	dogs	would	have	lost	his	scent	because	of	the	water	,	right	?
i	have	feelings	for	you	.	i	do	n't	want	to	ruin	our	friendship	.
uh	,	daughter	is	up	in	c.	u.	,	and	she	needs	an	update	.
the	sun	even	shines	on	a	dog	's	ass	some	days	.
but	i	think	your	boy	is	gon	na	be	exposed	here
have	n't	you	enjoyed	my	acting	?	which	film	did	you	like	best	?
and	if	you	look	at	the	portrait	,	you	will	see	again	that	it	has	a	black	frame	around	it	,
so	riots	and	fires	are	not	fatal	,	like	personal	grudges	.
i	feel	like	hell	.	every	time	i	look	in	the	mirror	,	i	wanna	scream	.
he	has	been	working	since	the	last	15	years	at	my	shop	.
our	spacious	whirlpool	room	offers	a	32	-	inch	hd	lcd	tv	,	mp3	alarm	clock	radio	,	microwave	,	and	mini	refrigerator	.

globos	diamonds	paid	dennis	p.	his	salaries	for	another	six	months	...
if	we	were	100	feet	higher	,	i	'd	jump	and	leave	you	here	.
because	i	can	pull	out	the	old	jean	jacket	and	do	kind	of	a	clooney	thing	with	my	hair	.
you	might	have	a	deal	with	her	,	but	do	n't	have	one	with	me	.
these	are	the	only	plants	that	thrive	on	the	poor	soil
okay	,	i	do	n't	want	you	in	here	anymore	.	please	leave	.
how	did	he	get	exposed	to	weapons	-	grade	uranium	?
because	you	entered	into	our	little	wager	under	false	pretenses	,	my	friend	.
you	try	to	do	this	without	me	!	-	how	are	you	seeing	us	right	now	?
but	i	'm	son	of	god	,	i	wo	n't	be	deceived	by	you	.
pinnacle	will	give	us	the	corroborating	paperwork	to	verify	this	.
ca	n't	you	just	tell	me	how	this	ends	and	save	us	the	trouble	?
i	love	you	so	much	and	wish	you	and	your	prince	nothing	but	happiness	.
whatever	he	was	trying	to	say	and	wanted	to	give	me	a	condom	,	and	it	all	became	real	.
is	recognizing	that	the	answers	to	our	most	burning	questions
hey	,	how	many	times	a	week	do	you	think	we	do	it	?
i	was	attacked	by	a	coked	-	up	whore	-
splendid	.	i	'm	a	great	admirer	of	your	magazine	,	mr	.	connor	.
do	you	think	you	're	going	to	land	the	plane	and	arrest	hector	?
we	're	at	the	top	of	the	windmill	now	and	this	is	the	gearing	system	.
he	was	hoping	that	we	would	sing	,	uh	,	gold	watch	and	chain	.
yes	.	exactly	.	that	's	why	i	've	got	to	get	out	of	here	.
we	were	just	about	to	ask	you	the	same	question	.	you	think
do	n't	let	me	lie	here	till	i	ca	n't	hear	those	people	chanting	no	more	.
anyway	,	i	got	a	lot	of	work	to	do	before	dinner	tonight	.
no	,	you	just	left	13	voice	mails	on	my	phone	at	three	o'clock	this	morning	.
i	've	been	at	work	all	day	,	and	i	just	want	to	unwind	.
i	bet	you	did	n't	write	one	word	down	on	that	little	notebook	,	pro	sky	gave	us	.
want	to	do	public	's	precept	y	person	sustainability	.
in	fact	,	if	you	want	to	sign	a	couple	of	them	,	you	can
about	baltimore	schools	,	but	i	find	that	to	be	cynical	and	disappointing	.
go	and	assemble	a	squad	of	armed	men	.	quickly	and	quietly	.
oh	,	my	god	.	i	'm	sorry	.	-	are	you	kidding	me	?
mama	,	why	are	you	so	slow	?	because	i	'm	old	,	baby	.	i	'm	old	.
if	i	go	back	there	,	it	's	to	pack	up	my	suitcase	,	okay	?
she	's	fine	.	she	's	with	five	agents	that	are	about	to	arrest	obadiah
they	never	made	it	-	a	little	bit	ahead	of	their	time	.
all	right	,	let	's	run	down	to	the	deli	,	grab	a	sandwich
yeah	,	that	's	a	reconstruction	of	the	face	of	the	second	woman	.
look	,	i	know	he	's	a	big	basketball	star	and	everything	,
i	mean	,	i	feel	like	i	'm	okay	'cause	i	passed	on	the	crazy	.
or	is	it	possible	that	the	builders	of	these	engineering	marvels
thank	you	all	for	coming	to	our	performance	at	ocean	world	.
only	in	nine	states	,	and	this	is	n't	one	of	them	.
just	so	we	'd	take	him	out	of	his	room	so	you	could	plant	the	bug	.
hello	?	can	you	get	up	here	?	the	ac	is	on	the	fritz	.
so	,	i	'm	tired	.	i	have	n't	slept	in	twenty	-	four	hours	.
i	am	the	friend	of	the	lover	of	your	classmate	in	the	high	school	.
i	'd	like	to	figure	that	out	too	.	maybe	you	can	help	me	.
all	the	signs	were	there	.	i	just	did	n't	see	them	.
but	you	ca	n't	let	him	.	i	'll	take	care	of	it	.
she	wants	to	help	you	.	she	's	a	doctor	for	a	reason	.
it	's	the	strangling	,	not	the	sex	that	brings	them	on	.
so	you	do	want	alcohol	?	you	want	some	or	no	?
i	just	relocated	from	phoenix	myself	.	i	'm	looking	for	a	place	.
hmm	,	but	i	wonder	how	much	they	'd	love	me	if	they	knew	i	was	fucking	their	daughter	.
want	to	take	a	ride	,	go	see	him	,	have	her	checked	out	?
all	rooms	are	suites	featuring	a	separate	bedroom	,	living	room	,	kitchenette	and	free	high	-	speed	internet	.
my	boss	said	i	can	deliver	ice	if	i	learn	to	drive	.
his	injury	may	not	be	as	visible	as	your	father	's	,	but	...	it	's	just	as	real	.
three	months	from	now	you	're	going	to	adult	prison	,	yeah	?
but	only	so	i	could	break	in	and	steal	her	gun	.
forgive	my	ignorance	,	but	do	n't	you	need	to	hook	up	.
when	i	found	out	you	two	were	having	a	kid	,
he	ca	n't	handle	the	fact	that	i	'm	a	bigger	deal	than	he	is	now	.
so	during	down	times	,	you	work	out	,	eat	right	,	and	try	to	recharge	your	batteries	,
beautiful	photos	.	i	do	n't	think	that	i	compliment	you	on	your	work	enough	.
you	know	,	this	is	what	i	've	always	liked	about	new	york	-
he	even	convinced	several	congressional	committees	to	give	them	a	test	run	.
dennis	,	your	dad	's	name	is	on	the	lease	,	as	well	.
maybe	we	could	have	a	little	belated	party	here	in	the	hospital	,	get	you	an	ice	cream	cake	.
but	i	know	someone	who	's	been	on	the	other	side	of	those	walls
if	she	brings	it	up	,	i	will	confirm	that	it	is	a	lie	,
he	's	got	a	credit	card	with	his	name	on	it	.
ceiling	fan	in	the	vanity	area	allows	for	air	movement	without	the	a	/	c.
the	best	western	hotel	royale	boasts	64	bedrooms	,	our	superior	twin	rooms	offer	two	single	beds	.
but	hundreds	of	miles	away	,	this	570	-	pound	stainless	steel	tank
it	's	just	this	one	ear	when	i	was	a	kid	i	had	this	accident	.
all	right	,	stuart	?	all	right	.	i	'll	be	right	with	you	.
and	when	we	survive	the	day	,	i	am	going	to	eat	that	fucking	witch	,
for	an	earthquake	,	you	'd	have	to	play	many	more	tournaments	at	krewe	island	-
i	got	ta	go	work	on	the	scanner	-	do	n't	go	.
i	know	.	i	'm	sorry	.	i	just	thought	,	you	know	,	that	you	-
but	that	does	n't	mean	that	you	can	just	show	up
if	things	get	bad	,	you	can	stay	in	my	room	as	long	as	you	want	.
in	bed	.	i	'm	in	bed	every	night	by	that	time	.
unreal	.	you	hire	a	guy	to	do	a	job	on	one	day	,
hey	,	this	is	what	got	us	in	trouble	in	the	first	place	.
then	again	it	would	n't	be	hard	to	find	out	whose	code	was	punched
he	liked	your	country	.	he	was	going	to	be	in	diplomatic	service	.
he	ca	n't	go	to	the	police	,	and	he	does	n't	trust	other	witches
i	know	dr	hoffmann	of	stuttgart	.	that	's	right	,	the	great	hoffmann	.
we	've	always	had	the	plan	to	try	to	be	as	strong	as	possible	.
i	'll	leave	from	here	in	the	morning	,	that	way	i	'll	reach	sooner	.
so	wait	for	the	mom	and	ask	,	spare	her	the	needle	if	you	can	.
she	should	in	ground	unsanctified	have	lodged	till	the	last	trumpet
if	you	want	,	i	'll	still	continue	with	the	story	.	does	that	sound	good	?
unwind	on	the	premises	,	too	-	many	guests	enjoy	relaxing	in	our	indoor	pool	,	outdoor	pool	and	hot	tub	.
i	dreamed	of	a	coffin	,	my	husband	was	sleeping	inside	.
and	you	used	to	look	like	your	mom	.	-	max	.
i	told	you	it	's	a	private	conversation	.	what	the	fuck	do	you	want	?	.
were	people	who	were	somehow	half	-	alien	,	half	-	human	.
this	stuff	will	taste	like	finest	burgundy	wine	where	she	's	going	.
just	because	we	ca	n't	see	anybody	,	does	n't	mean	no	one	's	here	.
the	things	you	see	when	you	're	out	without	your	gun	.
i	did	n't	mean	to	.	i	know	.	god	,	jeff	.	i	was	so	drunk	.
right	.	you	do	know	the	point	is	to	remove	the	human	remains	.
can	we	call	respiratory	to	get	a	vent	down	here	?
it	was	of	a	song	that	he	kept	singing	.
knowing	that	he	's	a	father	who	's	a	serial	killer	who	might	be	overprotective	,
you	mind	telling	me	why	i	'm	catching	attitude	from	her	?
you	got	what	?	one	hundred	and	ten	years	on	the	job	between	you	two	of	here	?
if	i	've	ever	had	any	success	in	this	life	,	it	's	because	of	you	.
but	if	you	're	in	a	pinch	you	can	shoot	and	move	with	this	.
but	she	did	ask	to	see	you	in	her	office	the	second	you	got	back	.
i	want	you	to	go	into	that	school	's	payroll	office	and	-
i	knew	it	was	dark	,	but	i	had	no	idea	how	dark	.
rooms	for	the	physically	challenged	:	4	,	the	rooms	are	on	the	ground	floor
mama	,	i	have	been	accused	of	opening	a	secret	account	for	papa	.
you	hang	out	with	nice	people	,	you	get	nice	friends	?
she	said	that	she	did	n't	like	the	way	i	spoke	to	her	.
i	thought	that	maybe	if	i	do	n't	tell	my	friends
i	forgot	to	ask	that	they	be	years	of	youth	.
it	'd	be	weird	if	we	were	all	in	the	ladies	'	room	.
it	's	just	that	your	psychic	thing	-
who	will	carry	the	secrets	of	the	tombs	,	after	me	.
you	stick	to	your	own	position	and	you	jump	higher	!
but	why	beat	him	if	you	were	going	to	kill	him	anyway	?
everyone	that	jumped	with	a	leg	bag	,	they	lost	it	.
i	know	how	it	is	walking	around	with	something	evil	inside	you	.
i	know	you	're	under	a	lot	of	stress	right	now	,
she	was	mad	,	and	my	dad	was	mad	,	and	i	always	get	in	the	way	.
and	i	could	get	down	the	driveway	-	give	me	the	phone	.
i	just	peed	on	that	.	for	god	sake	,	put	it	on	a	coaster	.
carter	,	get	to	the	back	.	come	on	,	you	lazy	bastard	.
so	we	have	to	be	careful	and	it	takes	more	times
i	did	n't	say	l	was	a	yankees	second	baseman	,	l	just	said	...
you	got	to	find	him	and	get	him	out	of	there	.
ladies	and	gentlemen	,	i	present	to	you	the	dream	team	.
heartache	is	a	part	of	life	.	we	know	that	now	.
back	to	rome	,	to	look	at	first	a	building	called	the	tabularium	,	that	dates	to	around	78	b.	c.
have	you	seen	the	manuscript	that	i	was	reading	earlier	?
but	do	n't	you	think	she	's	been	crucified	enough	for	that	already	?	seriously	.
what	?	the	pound	?	where	would	you	get	a	crazy	idea	like	that	?
i	invited	pam	over	when	we	were	having	a	drink	last	night	.
you	would	still	stay	good	with	that	side	of	the	house	.
i	spent	all	afternoon	with	a	guy	who	does	this	kind	of	shit	for	real	.
okay	,	so	what	?	we	're	gon	na	go	back	and	kill	hitler	?
we	are	not	pros	.	but	we	could	be	much	better
i	used	to	haul	supplies	for	j	and	r	and	let	me	tell	you	,	they	are	very
at	penn	inn	roundabout	take	the	first	exit	onto	shaldon	road	(	signposted	milber	,	combeinteignhead	)	.
if	big	had	any	class	,	he	would	've	moved	away	.	i	was	here	first	.
but	i	did	see	one	thing	how	much	i	hurt	you	.
what	?	honey	,	yes	.	i	have	a	lot	going	on	right	now	.
intake	sent	you	up	here	?	yeah	,	my	wife	's	contractions	are	less	than	-
do	you	think	he	found	that	bloody	dog	yet	?	oh	,	mr	brown	is	on	holiday	.
well	,	i	've	been	looking	at	the	information	that	is	coming	in	from	these	tip	lines	.
absolutely	.	very	much	so	.	listen	,	i	just	want	to	let	you	know
i	've	lived	in	a	place	like	this	,	hiding	from	assassins	for	14	years	.
you	never	actually	wrote	any	vows	from	you	to	me	.
glad	to	see	you	made	it	back	to	the	party	.
i	know	i	'm	the	last	person	you	wanna	see	right	now	,
do	n't	worry	.	those	tickets	are	in	a	very	safe	place	.
so	there	's	gon	na	be	some	kind	of	play	that	goes	down	.
i	've	heard	it	's	happened	that	way	.	you	must	have	too	.
we	celebrate	and	take	comfort	that	what	's	impossible	ca	n't	be	possible	!
for	the	next	few	games	...	we	do	mostly	chants	,	but	not	lame	ones	.
he	was	sitting	right	there	when	i	came	out	to	get	you	.
she	's	up	there	on	the	top	floor	.	i	tried	.
business	travelers	will	also	appreciate	the	convenience	of	this	edinburgh	hotel	.
you	need	to	leave	open	the	possibility	of	a	stretch	-	mark	fetishist	.
do	n't	be	shy	,	sheila	.	come	over	here	.	what	are	you	going	to	do	?
all	i	can	say	is	,	tonight	's	show	is	gon	na	be	a	mess	.
it	has	no	place	in	your	future	,	nor	in	mine	.
we	'd	be	together	,	and	i	'd	have	a	family	instead	of	walking	pneumonia	and	an	ex	-	best	friend	who	hates	me	.
you	're	asking	me	whether	i	'm	suspicious	but	if	i	'm	suspicious	,	i	'm	not	going	to	tell	you	.
you	have	n't	been	driven	to	it	by	some	oppressive	social	force	.
when	i	was	at	the	bureau	'	we	had	to	qualify	once	a	year	on	the	range	.
if	you	're	fearless	,	you	're	thorough	,	you	tell	the	absolute	truth	.
hi	,	girlfriend	.	let	's	go	out	this	weekend	and	talk	about	you	.
what	are	you	doing	?	what	did	you	think	we	're	gon	na	burn	?
well	,	uh	,	over	the	holidays	,	i	'm	supposed	to	go	on	a	cave	-	diving	trip	to	mexico	.
all	tanks	acquire	solution	and	prepare	to	fire	on	my	order	.
look	,	you	would	n't	beat	up	a	woman	any	more	than	l	would	beat	up	a	cripple	.
tony	,	did	you	get	him	?	we	're	working	on	it	.	adam	?
we	've	got	one	at	three	o'clock	.	-	on	the	ground	,	got	four	.
along	with	one	grandchild	who	i	think	might	be	illegitimate	.
last	night	you	looked	so	fabulous	in	that	wonderful	full	-	length	sable	coat	.
you	lie	to	me	.	you	lie	to	me	,	and	you	do	it	so	well	!
do	you	think	you	could	rustle	up	this	...	spirit	of	yours	?
i	know	it	because	it	went	to	me	to	first	whom	they	hired	.
i	'm	gon	na	give	you	my	direct	line	.	have	you	got	a	pen	?
get	the	bloodhounds	.	raise	all	the	men	you	can	,	lock	the	women	indoors
if	i	lived	your	life	,	if	i	knew	what	i	knew	i	would	n't	be	you	.
i	have	a	prime	time	speech	at	the	convention
i	want	in	.	i	want	in	on	the	con	.	this	is	not	about	the	money	.
your	uncle	will	teach	you	when	he	comes	back	.	he	can	wait	.	go	to	your	mother	.
and	he	started	to	get	mad	.	and	one	day	he	started	yelling	,
it	is	to	raise	spirits	in	this	dark	time	that	i	and	my	wife	are	giving	this	party	.
oh	,	a	couple	of	years	at	least	,	in	your	case	.
i	'm	acting	as	department	liaison	for	the	ntsb	boys	on	the	crash	.
i	'm	sure	there	's	none	of	you	who	's	been	in	rome	who	has	n't	been	inside	the	pantheon	.
we	a	have	to	put	something	up	on	the	internet
he	's	holding	a	frag	grenade	.	the	pin	has	been	pulled	.
i	made	them	put	you	on	the	list	.	that	's	nice	.
but	if	he	is	gon	na	go	to	a	park	,	a	children	's	park	,
she	soon	came	to	terms	with	it	.	now	she	covers	for	me	.
i	think	we	get	so	often	get	caught	in	this	state	of	negativity	and
hey	,	i	know	you	.	you	're	that	feller	from	the	karate	demonstration	.
well	,	hey	,	that	's	fine	.	i	've	got	everything	i	need	to	make	an	assessment	,
i	asked	for	more	time	to	prepare	my	statement	for	the	board
there	's	this	little	restaurant	i	know	,	and	i	would	love	to	take	you	there	.
from	the	moment	i	stood	up	in	the	training	yard	,	i	've	only	thought	of	the	next	move	.
i	came	back	from	d.	c.	early	,	and	i	lost	my	darn	key	.
into	an	even	crappier	one	so	that	your	kids	could	have	a	good	time	.
you	wish	i	'd	hurt	but	i	'm	free	as	a	bird
i	saw	that	they	had	some	sort	of	artsy	spoken	-	word	thing	there	tonight	.
see	,	i	'm	not	built	to	work	five	days	a	week	.
sorry	,	they	'll	try	to	distinguish	it	by	relying	on	the	minority	opinion	.
you	do	n't	seem	to	annoy	me	as	much	as	usual	.
at	7	o'clock	.	ok	,	and	may	i	have	your	name	?
get	up	,	you	will	be	first	,	you	right	here	in	hots	pot	.
you	want	it	so	bad	,	and	now	you	just	fucked	it	all	up	.
was	just	an	act	of	terrorism	in	my	judgment	,	and	those	are	the	...
then	a	couple	weeks	ago	,	a	punk	ass	kid	comes	around	.
had	a	little	brother	bit	.	he	took	less	than	an	hour	before	he	turned	.
and	my	mother	,	she	-	she	came	from	a	wealthy	family	.
definitely	left	me	wondering	.	uh	,	what	kind	of	sick	mind	came	up	with	that	stuff	.
miss	van	der	woodsen	hopes	to	bed	as	many	billionaires	as	she	can	before	settling	down	to	-
and	you	drag	us	down	here	to	chase	down	cate	?
me	,	i	'm	from	a	small	town	you	probably	never	even	heard	of	.
bad	news	is	,	we	're	bringing	him	in	with	a	lawyer	from	the	archdiocese	.
you	guys	seen	john	?	is	he	back	here	?
i	am	in	hell	!	i	ca	n't	stand	it	any	more	!
if	you	give	us	another	week	,	we	can	find	out	what	this	witness	knows	,
you	have	to	get	him	to	hide	better	or	something	.
i	was	about	to	kiss	you	and	i	woke	up	.
i	am	so	getting	into	that	party	tonight	for	sure	.
the	victim	's	mom	and	suiving	son	are	waiting	to	claim	the	body	,
go	back	to	where	you	came	from	.	i	said	,	go	back	!	back	!
if	we	can	find	the	smuggler	,	we	can	find	the	buyer	.
i	'll	be	back	at	it	in	the	morning	.	just	need	a	little	nap	.
what	do	you	want	me	to	do	lose	this	thing	?
do	you	think	my	dad	's	going	to	freak	out	about	us	getting	married	too	young	?
oh	,	my	god	.	i	did	n't	just	say	that	,	did	i	?
i	mean	,	i	ca	n't	imagine	that	people	would	have	the	passion	to	care	about	the	wild
me	too	.	what	grade	are	you	in	?	fifth	,	and	you	?
all	right	,	get	him	back	in	here	,	so	i	can	talk	to	him	!
we	forgot	one	.	we	almost	forgot	you	!	you	're	always	disappearing	on	me	.
but	i	'm	gon	na	go	with	you	.	i	'm	gon	na	oversee	this	.
at	the	present	day	of	course	,	the	ecumenical	patriarch	of	constantinople
and	always	talking	about	art	and	books	and	movies	and	everything	.
we	have	a	nice	apartment	and	a	house	in	the	country	.
that	's	something	you	're	gon	na	have	to	talk	to	him	about	.
we	'll	get	you	a	deal	.	no	,	you	ca	n't	make	that	promise	.
you	feather	head	,	martindale	!	you	pompous	,	bogus	,	gossiping	old	feather	head	!
while	searching	for	their	master	,	they	arrived	in	this	city	.
which	means	i	'll	be	president	,	and	you	can	make	all	the	boring	decisions	.
hotel	opening	soon	-	accepting	reservations	in	advance	of	opening	-	june	15	,	2014
bottom	line	i	can	take	it	to	the	next	level	.
so	i	'm	gon	na	be	honest	with	you	.	right	now	,	you	and	chong	are	tied	.
so	i	threw	the	keys	in	the	water	.	oh	,	god	!
it	came	with	a	black	dude	,	but	he	kept	getting	pulled	over	.
well	,	i	hope	you	're	right	,	because	the	boss	is	on	his	way	here	now	.
her	personal	life	may	have	been	a	bit	of	a	mess	,	but	she	was	extremely	professional	.
at	night	,	you	will	sleep	well	thanks	to	the	comfortable	king	bed	.
i	know	,	but	what	if	they	did	n't	find	her	?	what	if	her	body	's	still	inside	?
movies	,	we	get	up	early	in	the	morning	like	in	the	military	.
hey	,	you	know	i	think	we	're	going	in	the	wrong	direction	.
come	on	.	you	and	i	know	each	other	too	long	for	me	to	believe
uh	,	yeah	,	but	i	did	n't	think	it	would	be	so	much	...	-	work	?
you	deserve	to	slap	someone	in	his	face	as	hard	as	you	can	.
i	know	that	must	sound	a	little	bitchy	.
i	should	n't	have	acted	that	way	in	front	of	karl	and	my	mother	.
it	was	the	first	thing	i	crossed	off	my	list	.
i	care	about	a	confession	she	freely	gave	me	that	.

i	do	n't	want	to	get	tossed	out	because	of	you	.
fortunate	indeed	to	have	two	ladies	by	your	side	on	sunday	evening	.

she	's	never	going	to	leave	him	.	do	you	get	that	?
i	mean	the	way	she	talked	about	being	there	mentally
and	why	would	they	admit	to	that	?	the	wire	fell	on	the	sabbath	.
well	,	i	ca	n't	leave	this	for	you	on	your	voicemail	,	so	call	me	,	ok	.
just	as	we	have	to	accept	the	consequences	of	believing	in	them
i	asked	him	to	leave	and	he	went	crazy	on	us	.

for	nine	years	i	was	working	at	state	farm	in	mostly	,	stettin	voivodship	.
so	you	see	,	i	take	a	great	deal	of	pride	in	what	i	do	.
i	told	myself	that	the	time	i	spent	with	you	.
but	the	doctors	say	there	's	no	telling	the	extent	of	the	damage	.
you	want	me	to	be	your	guardian	,	i	have	to	right	to	know	.
what	i	'm	doing	out	here	is	three	times	more	dangerous	than	regular	sword	swallowing	.
i	can	see	in	his	face	how	close	he	is	to	exploding	.

a	cell	conversation	he	had	with	a	contact	in	caracas	.
oh	,	you	have	the	wrong	person	takashi	's	here	at	home
one	of	them	so	he	would	know	when	they	were	in	place	.
i	mean	,	she	'd	have	to	be	zeus	to	pull	that	off	.
doctor	,	you	are	going	to	tell	me	what	the	fuck	is	going	on	up	here	.
if	you	swear	to	share	what	you	know	with	me	,
oh	,	do	n't	be	so	heartless	.	look	,	they	are	two	consenting	adults	...	that	's	not	what	i	'm	concerned	about	,	doctor	.
there	are	other	women	out	there	who	are	better	mothers	than	they	were	.
when	i	was	a	kid	,	i	had	this	morning	paper	route	.

so	,	you	stir	things	up	.	you	put	a	couple	of	people	up	on	the	roof
in	your	sleep	,	wailing	from	what	you	've	done	over	there	?
if	it	were	possible	it	would	defeat	the	entire	purpose	of	surrogacy	.

what	the	artist	might	be	trying	to	say	to	you	.
do	you	think	she	's	in	on	it	?	one	way	to	find	out	.
so	it	falls	on	me	to	do	all	his	bitch	work	.

you	know	i	found	him	the	one	place	we	always	went	to	as	kids	.
because	he	's	been	doing	coke	in	the	men	's	room	ever	since	i	've	been	here	.
but	you	said	to	be	honest	.	i	did	not	say	to	humiliate	me	!

he	waited	for	it	to	surface	through	a	hole	in	the	ice
and	i	was	like	,	wow	,	that	's	where	i	have	to	sit	in	line	today	.
and	it	only	takes	us	to	make	one	slight	mistake
all	the	evidence	you	think	you	have	to	the	sec	.
oh	,	thank	you	for	opening	the	doorway	device	which	you	call	iris	.
if	i	show	up	in	my	wedges	,	are	they	gon	na	get	mushy	?
well	,	it	was	really	sweet	,	and	like	the	most	romantic	thing	ever	.
it	's	this	fantasy	i	've	had	since	i	was	a	little	girl	.
let	's	just	get	a	fried	pie	,	a	couple	fried	marshmallows	.

why	is	she	screaming	?	i	'm	the	one	who	should	be	screaming	.
a	baby	went	missing	from	a	clinic	in	washington	heights	last	night	.
but	after	our	lone	witness	went	missing	,	no	charges	were	ever	filed	.
why	not	now	?	it	's	thanksgiving	.	families	gather	.	issues	come	up	.
the	breakfast	choices	include	cereal	,	oatmeal	,	juice	,	tea	,	hot	waffles	,	fruit	,	100	%	arabica	coffee	and	pastries	.
you	wo	n't	have	to	.	it	'll	be	like	we	're	really	doing	the	job	.
he	's	unavailable	,	sir	.	i	need	to	see	him	.	where	is	he	?
you	need	something	,	you	ask	her	,	she	talks	to	me	,	we	decide	.
i	'd	go	to	school	wearing	a	blouse	,	that	's	just	the	way	it	was	,
did	you	know	i	was	pregnant	?	he	conveniently	left	that	out	.
to	be	part	the	show	would	be	probably	the	coolest	thing	that	has	happened	to	me	.
i	'll	take	care	of	the	girl	.	then	we	can	leave	.
you	put	up	with	a	lot	of	shit	when	you	're	dating	a	hot	girl	.
but	i	will	pay	you	back	with	interest	.	-	i	do	n't	want	interest	.
i	know	what	you	're	thinking	.	you	’re	trying	not	to	panic	.
you	seem	to	have	a	40	year	old	dog	on	your	hands	.
i	ca	n't	remember	the	last	time	anyone	brought	those	two	and	their	friends	together	.
i	want	to	know	everything	about	him	by	the	time	i	get	back	.	and	you	,
i	'm	sharing	it	with	an	army	captain	that	was	more	than	a	little	patronizing	about	my	work	.
wanna	get	spanked	,	a	little	one	-	on	-	one	?	no	,	i	'm	good	.
i	'm	sure	he	'll	find	a	way	.	-	can	you	really	blame	him	?
each	year	,	the	history	guild	honors	one	research	paper	for	its	distinction	and	academic	excellence	.
all	included	in	this	room	is	a	shower	,	toilet	,	hairdryer	in	the	bathroom	and	is	air	conditioned	.
if	you	had	n't	done	anything	,	it	might	have	become	any	number	of	things	.
but	i	ca	n't	get	into	a	system	that	i	created	.
and	why	not	?	it	's	about	time	that	one	of	us	ended	up	in	a	position	of	real	power	.
the	cook	,	little	hitler	and	nook	the	rook	and	somebody	i	've	never	seen	before	.
so	i	got	it	into	my	head	that	i	'd	walk	to	albany	.
i	know	you	think	i	'm	as	bad	as	them	less	than	savory	characters	that	i	represent	,
just	like	you	did	when	i	won	that	scholarship	at	my	high	-	school	graduation	.
so	you	decided	to	wreck	my	case	?	well	,	hardly	wrecked	.
because	they	wanted	to	steal	the	colt	an	from	great	tiger	,
do	you	remember	a	few	years	ago	,	a	vote	about	me	?
that	were	working	the	sale	,	including	the	banking	and	legal	teams	.	right	.
this	is	how	the	bad	guy	gets	us	every	time	!
um	，	i	believe	she	worked	a	security	detail	for	me	earlier	in	the	week	-
oh	,	my	god	.	he	's	so	hot	.	but	he	's	like	11	years	old	.
yeah	,	that	does	seem	a	little	strange	for	a	woman	who	spends	her	whole	life	on	the	water	.
why	was	he	crying	his	heart	out	in	your	room	last	night	?
no	way	!	only	a	jerk	would	upset	a	gentle	giant	.
if	you	tell	anybody	,	it	will	shatter	the	fabric	of	our	civilization	.
to	dump	her	husband	and	fall	in	love	with	you	all	over	again	.
hikes	it	up	and	goes	,	oh	,	look	.	i	've	got	me	naughty	bits	tucked	under	.
is	that	why	i	got	the	bounce	?	he	wo	n't	talk	to	you	.
i	will	call	him	but	please	do	n't	say	this	in	front	of	him	.
well	,	our	friend	...	did	he	have	a	woman	with	him	?
but	what	i	have	done	is	find	you	a	noose	.
i	have	a	house	in	monterey	,	but	i	'm	never	there	.
oh	,	was	the	little	bird	looking	at	the	calendar	on	my	desk	?
the	peoples	center	offers	educational	tours	,	while	the	whitefish	mountain	ski	resort	and	black	tail	mountain	ski	resort	are	nearby	.
just	a	boy	with	his	head	badly	.	and	if	you	do	not	believe	me	believe	it	.
stripes	,	let	the	dress	just	fall	down	.	keep	the	stripes	straight	.
right	,	'cause	you	do	n't	wanna	walk	around	with	that	kind	of	cabbage	.
this	is	exactly	how	i	was	replaced	in	the	brit	boyz	.
we	are	going	to	have	a	good	time	tonight	,	boss	.
we	had	great	sex	,	babe	.	it	was	loving	and	sexy
and	what	on	earth	did	you	do	to	him	to	make	him	agree	to	that	?
complimentary	full	breakfast	,	freshly	prepared	waffles	,	eggs	,	sausage	,	buscuits	and	gravy
but	you	're	gon	na	meet	a	lot	of	stupid	people	in	your	life	,	and	they	're	just	not	gon	na	get	you	.
and	he	and	his	friends	broke	in	here	two	nights	ago	.
well	,	me	and	the	other	fellas	,	we	're	binder	boys	,	see	?
it	's	so	easy	for	you	,	huh	?	are	you	playing	some	game	?
why	are	you	talking	to	me	like	a	mom	?	i	thought	we	were	best	friends	now	.
yeah	,	well	,	it	was	n't	exactly	what	i	had	planned	,	either	.
i	could	n't	beat	them	up	,	so	i	learned	to	compensate	.
i	just	come	for	an	apology	.	that	's	it	.	just	look	me	in	the	eye	and	say	you	're	sorry	.
um	,	that	cop	-	he	said	that	you	told	the	police
from	ta	's	pub	to	compete	for	the	national	collegiate	championship	!
i	'm	going	to	pass	.	the	only	people	making	money	passing	are	n.	f.	l.	quarterbacks	.
took	several	hours	every	day	to	get	her	ready	for	the	wheelchair	.
if	you	forget	everything	l	will	pop	up	out	of	nowhere	.
with	a	working	volcano	that	spews	lava	on	the	hour	.
so	you	think	that	could	've	happened	when	he	drove	her	to	hospital	?
gentlemen	,	this	is	the	final	.	i	expect	a	clean	fight	.
i	have	n't	got	a	brother	.	well	,	he	wo	n't	know	that	.
you	have	to	avenge	the	death	of	your	bosses	,	right	?
oh	,	please	.	i	do	n't	even	think	you	could	work	a	blender	.
when	you	're	up	to	your	ankles	,	you	're	gon	na	beg	to	tell	me	everything	.
ok	.	now	this	watch	will	only	be	in	my	shop	!
it	's	none	of	our	business	ca	n't	you	just	leave	it	alone	?
i	only	convinced	her	last	year	that	i	'm	not	gay	.
because	the	only	thing	you	're	gon	na	get	in	here	is	curbed	for	a	chicago	smile	and
while	you	're	doing	that	,	we	'll	look	for	your	adopted	friend	's	birth	records	.
so	what	are	we	gon	na	do	now	?	i	'm	gon	na	go	meet	some	people	?
i	mean	,	he	had	these	terms	he	judged	relationships	by	,	and	if	you	tried	to	change	them
see	,	you	have	to	look	at	the	big	picture	here	.
if	you	don	get	back	to	that	o.	r.	today	shepherd	.
but	if	you	want	a	better	quality	it	'll	take	a	few	days	.
but	you	put	some	money	where	that	big	mouth	of	yours	is	.	hold	on	,	dude	.
we	need	to	know	it	's	there	.	we	need	to	know	it	's	safe	.
i	thought	of	you	.	in	reality	i	thought	of	us	.
i	'm	not	trying	to	pull	you	into	any	of	my	stuff	.
and	once	we	're	out	,	i	want	you	to	lay	dead	on	the	bottom
okay	,	so	how	do	we	protect	her	from	walter	sykes
and	for	some	reason	i	find	you	ridiculously	attractive	for	saying	that	.
may	i	sit	?	not	just	yet	.	what	is	it	you	want	?
even	though	you	get	your	birthrate	down	,	your	population	keeps	increasing	so	extremely	.
which	means	they	either	come	to	us	or	they	die	.
i	have	no	time	to	discuss	the	medication	issue	with	you
what	?	if	you	pull	that	trigger	,	you	'll	be	pulling	it	for	free	.
hey	,	hey	,	get	off	me	.	-	what	are	you	doing	?
let	me	ask	you	.	this	is	a	very	difficult	market	environment	.
i	'll	get	it	out	,	but	i	'm	holding	on	to	it	.	you	understand	?
please	make	it	easy	on	me	and	lend	me	fire	monkey
had	to	go	off	to	mexico	,	the	states	,	chile	,	south	africa	.
we	're	gon	na	pull	this	asshole	off	the	street	as	soon	as	possible	.
if	people	thought	i	was	n't	even	safe	from	my	own	secret	service	?
i	put	it	on	that	table	right	over	there	.
it	adds	up	to	quite	a	lot	of	books	.	-	most	of	them	hers	.
yet	none	of	you	asks	me	where	i	am	going	.
well	,	could	you	cut	a	little	more	off	the	temple	?
preventing	this	place	from	being	totally	fucked	in	the	ass	.
pretty	soon	,	fall	will	be	here	.	it	'll	be	too	rough	a	trip	.
yeah	,	over	there	in	europe	there	's	only	two	americans	they	know	for	certain	...
when	i	finally	woke	up	,	i	was	like	that	was	n't	a	dream	.
i	'm	officially	out	of	the	dorm	and	on	my	way	back	to	the	kents	'	.
i	have	no	doubt	it	'd	be	my	obituary	you	'd	be	reading	tomorrow	.

i	have	moved	on	,	and	i	'm	happy	i	've	moved	on	.
i	do	n't	want	to	look	back	on	this	amazing	shoot	and	remember	that	and	always	be	reminded	of	this	.
i	'm	just	letting	you	all	know	that	i	'm	here	to	help	.

enjoy	your	meal	.	sir	,	i	swear	i	did	n't	do	anything	.
he	has	no	right	to	talk	to	you	like	that	.
i	'm	the	scariest	thing	in	new	york	,	jilted	at	41	.

all	right	,	all	right	,	john	,	the	conference	will	go	on	as	usual	.
i	may	not	have	been	here	long	,	but	i	've	learned	one	thing	.
from	the	ship	propeller	.	she	must	have	been	mangled	by	it	.
it	was	excellent	,	thank	you	.	i	know	you	guys	like	italian	food	,	so	i	am	making	fettuccine
i	idolized	you	from	the	moment	i	first	saw	you	...
will	you	run	the	three	-	legged	race	?	um	,	we	'll	see	,	we	'll	see	,	yeah	.
we	should	,	uh	,	we	should	get	together	and	pool	our	resources	.
if	i	could	remember	what	kind	of	woman	you	are	,	i	would	remember
but	with	the	warmest	people	and	i	really	mean	that	.
i	am	,	by	not	letting	him	know	about	the	money	you	found	...
if	you	're	doing	this	every	day	,	is	n't	your	arm	filled	with	needle	marks	?
i	do	n't	want	to	leave	.	i	want	to	talk	to	my	sister	.
if	he	knew	we	were	alive	,	he	might	not	do	this	thing	.
i	have	nothing	to	fear	from	the	truth	,	mr	.	president	.
no	.	i	'm	the	one	who	told	you	what	was	going	on	with	lux	and	tasha	.
i	'm	going	to	get	the	man	to	hospital	,	who	will	help	me	?
i	think	you	wanna	be	exactly	like	her	,	and	if	you	happen	to	lie	now	and	again	,
they	want	the	government	to	have	a	policy	on	the	matter	.
he	goes	up	and	gives	him	a	shot	in	the	eye	.
and	then	,	you	and	i	are	even	and	he	owes	me	one	?
but	i	'm	pretty	sure	it	did	n't	just	magically	turn	into	towels	.
but	if	you	had	read	the	report	on	the	armada	headed	this	way	,
just	wanted	you	to	see	what	the	other	side	of	this	looks	like	.
so	if	you	get	into	the	shit	,	you	trust	your	heart	...
with	no	doubt	one	of	my	many	flaws	.	-	please	do	n't	mock	me	,	prince	.
i	'm	proud	to	say	that	i	cast	that	vote	in	the	senate	.
i	know	i	did	n't	take	our	relationship	seriously	but	,	lori	,
but	what	would	you	say	if	-	sorry	.	just	the	one	question	,	please	.
i	do	n't	know	you	.	you	really	do	n't	remember	,	do	you	?
i	think	i	'm	pretty	nice	.	i	think	you	are	too	.
i	'm	picking	up	a	strange	reading	from	right	over	there	.

you	can	have	your	key	back	.	i	want	my	key	back	.
and	i	certainly	do	n't	want	to	leave	it	like	that	.
he	's	your	kid	and	i	really	should	be	heading	back	.

she	's	jealous	of	his	gift	,	and	it	's	a	fine	gift	.	it	's	rare	.
it	's	strange	how	you	always	manage	to	be	in	the	right	place	at	the	right	time	.
maybe	i	should	just	give	them	all	free	flu	shots	.
i	still	do	n't	know	what	to	get	you	.	-	huh	?
i	know	that	you	're	angry	and	that	none	of	this	makes	any	sense	.

when	the	body	of	a	young	woman	was	discovered	earlier	today	.
it	does	n't	matter	where	it	is	in	the	sky	or	where	you	are	.
she	opened	up	,	once	i	promised	to	keep	her	ice	-	capades	under	wraps	.
i	know	.	i	wonder	why	they	did	n't	just	say	so	.
it	's	safer	in	the	cockpit	than	the	cargo	bay	.	what	an	idiot	.
okay	,	i	'll	tell	him	to	keep	an	eye	out	for	you	.

well	,	i	'm	in	the	pit	with	medusa	today	if	anybody	wants	to	trade	with	me	.
i	tried	to	get	tickets	,	but	you	got	to	know	somebody	.

so	i	thought	i	'd	come	over	here	and	climb	through	your	window	.
but	when	you	've	been	a	certain	way	for	so	long	,
i	ca	n't	even	remember	most	of	yesterday	.	perhaps	i	can	help	you	.
you	'll	die	a	horrible	death	with	no	children	bearing	your	family	name	any	more	.
you	ca	n't	see	i	have	had	enough	of	you	,	can	you	?

i	'll	just	be	thinking	of	how	much	i	want	to	do	my	best	for	my	family	.
including	your	father	's	1957	dissertation	,	which	is	right	down	here	.
but	i	thought	it	did	n't	make	sense	,	even	for	him	.

i	mean	,	why	would	he	go	to	such	lengths	to	make	it	look	like	red	john	was	the	killer	?
give	me	the	backpack	.	i	'll	hide	it	-	no	.	dude	,	no	.
if	they	catch	me	with	this	then	they	will	make	me	a	jibba	like	you	.
yeah	,	well，i'm	kind	of	in	between	guys	right	now	.
if	you	like	tex	-	mex	,	there	is	no	place	better	.
i	'm	not	stupid	.	the	most	you	can	charge	me	for	is	having	that	money	.
i	do	n't	much	like	strangers	in	my	house	.	i	dare	say	in	the	south	,
you	think	her	name	might	be	connected	to	what	's	wrong	with	her	?
and	the	weirdest	thing	was	,	she	did	n't	even	know	who	he	was	.
so	the	notion	of	making	a	mockery	out	of	them	makes	me	angry	.
there	are	many	villages	that	have	not	been	ravaged	yet	by	the	pestilence	.
to	be	from	both	of	us	,	so	it	will	be	from	both	of	us	.
now	you	're	back	and	trying	to	make	him	think	it	's	for	real	.
george	,	i	'm	asking	you	to	try	and	see	the	larger	picture	.	-	hmm	.
i	know	this	has	been	quite	an	ordeal	for	you	,	but	it	had	to	happen	.
if	i	had	my	choice	i	miss	being	back	amongst	the	men	.
if	we	're	gon	na	win	this	,	we	need	to	come	up	with	something	-
may	i	ask	you	to	give	this	letter	to	lady	so	-	oak	?
another	joan	of	arc	,	george	sand	,	madame	curie	or	du	barry	.
is	there	a	patch	of	grass	somewhere	to	go	potty	?
i	missed	the	60s	and	i	believe	if	i	had	been	there	...
absolutely	.	-	all	right	,	we	should	get	going	.	okay	,
you	're	the	one	who	's	generally	responsible	for	doing	the	daily	inmate	checks	.
is	he	in	love	with	you	?	-	ask	him	yourself	.
we	've	got	a	woman	who	's	only	got	a	few	hours	left	to	live	,
but	you	look	at	brendan	like	you	're	two	steps	away	...
every	time	i	close	my	eyes	i	see	their	blond	hair	and	their	smug	,
he	was	the	original	u.s	.	importer	of	swiss	army	knives	.
all	u	had	to	do	was	stop	time	,	and	we	would	still	have	our	money
but	you	were	always	smart	about	it	.	she	was	stupid	.
let	's	just	say	,	that	was	a	very	important	day	in	my	life	.
i	have	n't	seen	him	in	weeks	.	-	oh	.	god	.	well	,	i	...	i	...
because	we	were	lied	to	for	a	really	long	time
it	'll	be	taken	as	an	admission	of	guilt	on	all	counts	,
i	got	no	idea	what	i	am	anymore	.	he	's	a	friend	.
if	cryazine	proves	effective	,	it	could	be	a	huge	step	forward	.
you	want	me	to	lie	to	some	woman	in	the	county	records	office	?
and	then	before	leaving	,	our	killer	was	nice	enough	to	call	9	-	1	-	1	and	leave	the	phone	off	the	hook	.
but	i	do	n't	know	what	you	think	it	's	gon	na	get	you	.
if	you	want	the	car	,	just	take	it	.	my	parents	got	me	the	wrong	one	anyway	.
i	know	.	so	what	are	we	going	to	do	about	it	?
now	go	make	up	for	all	the	work	you	missed	.
the	ex	-	president	of	the	united	states	and	,	many	say	,	the	most	popular	in	history	.
you	will	return	to	england	on	an	oil	tanker	with	a	new	identity	...
was	because	they	saw	two	suspicious	-	looking	gentlemen	...	with	bulges	in	their	jackets	going	into	the	place	.
and	i	just	ended	a	relationship	with	a	woman	i	thought	i	loved	.
if	she	want	to	fight	,	i	'll	give	her	a	fight	.
but	their	not	good	for	the	killings	.	they	both	got	out	of	county	this	morning	.
he	was	n't	even	booked	in	.	rest	of	you	,	tickets	in	advance	.
the	court	could	not	properly	hear	the	appeal	and	ordered	that	beamer	be	retried	.
but	if	we	leave	it	up	to	our	lawyers	,	this	case	will	go	on	for	a	long	,
i	have	no	feeling	below	my	waist	.	consider	yourself	lucky	.
but	he	's	so	full	of	himself	.	he	's	so	annoyingly	confident	.
come	on	,	lizzie	.	i	'm	already	totally	freaking	out	as	it	is	.
to	find	out	what	this	man	rambaldi	was	working	on	.
yeah	.	i	know	.	i	'm	just	i	'm	a	little	bit	stressed	out	.
and	let	nick	do	a	shot	from	my	belly	button	,	right	?
this	will	just	take	a	few	minutes	.	i	told	you	once	,	i	told	you	twice	,	now	go	:
she	was	my	girlfriend	for	two	hours	.
hurry	,	or	the	bus	will	leave	.	come	on	.	let	's	go	.
i	'm	gon	na	need	you	out	on	saturday	so	i	can	spray	the	place	with	insecticide	,
how	are	the	men	shaping	up	?	all	two	of	them	?
something	's	fucked	him	all	up	,	cain	,	and	we	got	to	figure	out	what	it	is	.
but	the	second	one	,	second	number	was	,	it	's	late	by	ricky	nelson	.
yeah	,	we	'll	have	to	clean	him	up	a	little	bit	.
cause	i	'm	just	someone	you	had	sex	with	once	and	slept	with	twice	.
and	i	've	never	been	on	one	with	a	woman	before	.
yeah	,	butt	-	naked	channels	.	you	like	butt	-	naked	?
he	was	a	nobody	who	wanted	to	be	somebody	by	killing	people	and	they	did	n't	give	him	that	.
i	think	you	're	the	most	beautiful	woman	i	've	ever	met	in	my	entire	life	.
if	i	stay	at	the	firm	,	it	has	to	be	more	.
i	'm	just	here	because	pete	asked	me	to	box	up	some	stuff	.
ten	thousand	soldiers	gave	their	lives	to	give	them	those	last	few	hours	.
but	has	some	superficial	resemblance	in	its	foot	to	our	footprints	,
how	long	's	it	take	to	get	a	calf	skull	from	egypt	?
lord	knows	i	love	him	,	but	here	's	to	a	night	without	him	.	to	the	kids	.
but	they	use	a	sesame	seed	bun	.	my	buns	have	no	seeds	.
well	,	it	's	like	a	medical	bed	,	you	know	,	for	having	babies	.
and	they	happily	give	back	a	couple	of	billion	dollars	in	wage	cuts	.
love	the	bag	,	love	the	shoes	,	love	everything	.	love	to	.
i	spent	an	hour	that	day	talking	to	the	rabbi	,
our	barrier	free	king	room	is	a	mobility	accessible	room	which	features	a	king	sized	bed	.
yeah	.	well	,	we	would	n't	want	to	piss	off	a	whole	field	of	dead	people	,
i	refuse	to	be	intimidated	.	those	ten	men	feel	the	same	way	.
do	me	a	favor	,	will	you	?	if	you	could
i	must	ask	you	to	hold	your	applause	drum	roll	please	.
i	'll	tell	you	what	we	'll	do	,	then	.	do	n't	get	the	table	ready	.
the	best	western	moffett	road	inn	welcomes	all	mardi	gras	visitors	to	mobile	.
i	need	to	find	out	what	they	were	arguing	about	.	i	would	love	to	help	,
find	the	witch	;	this	is	all	her	fault	!	strike	her	dead	!	!
you	just	put	all	your	focus	and	attention	on	your	task	at	hand	.
to	be	met	with	some	lackluster	salad	.	where	are	the	figs	?
even	though	they	've	spent	up	to	six	hours	exercising	each	day	...
you	know	what	i	got	for	my	ninth	birthday	?	a	bible	.
you	'll	never	disappear	from	them	,	and	you	will	always	be	there	...
of	course	they	are	.	but	we	've	taken	care	of	that	.	so	do	n't	worry	.
this	is	n't	gon	na	help	you	figure	out	whether	you	want	to	be	a	parent	...	or	not	.
as	of	what	to	eat	and	what	to	leave	alone	.
i	've	got	to	take	my	hat	off	to	this	mr	.	grove	.
come	on	.	am	i	the	only	one	who	thinks	this	is	cool	?
do	n't	you	see	that	i	have	a	show	to	do	?
i	've	just	been	enjoying	this	new	-	found	freedom	.	that	is	wonderful	.
but	on	your	on	-	hours	i	bring	you	to	men
when	he	was	a	kid	,	he	slept	on	the	floor	.
you	know	,	maybe	you	could	just	let	me	try	it	before	you	get	all	negative	on	me	.
if	he	wants	to	hold	our	feet	to	the	fire	...	i	get	it	.
the	deluxe	double	bedroom	offers	individual	air	-	conditioning	,	lcd	satellite	tv	,	a	safe	,	mini	-	bar	and	free	wlan	.
and	we	know	them	only	from	a	few	mangled	specimens	and	still	photographs	.
i	knew	it	.	that	makes	so	much	sense	,	man	.	look	,	he	's	a	virgin	.
i	mean	,	as	soon	as	marcie	mentioned	your	name	i	knew	,
i	've	been	putting	up	with	his	poetry	nonsense	for	14	years	.
sooner	or	later	both	of	us'll	probably	wind	up	dead	.
i	'll	remind	him	he	's	here	at	the	sufferance	of	the	committee	.
i	did	a	linguistic	match	on	the	bitcoin	manifesto	,	and	guess	what	popped	up	?
9	mile(s	)	from	snowmobiling	,	more	than	250	miles	of	trails	can	be	accessed	from	four	different	trail	parks	.
and	the	only	way	to	save	it	was	to	take	a	shower
you	have	as	much	to	lose	now	as	i	do	.
you	're	not	the	first	shoplifter	i	've	caught	,	but	you	're	the	first	one	that	's	gon	na	get	me	on	tv	.
this	is	,	uh	,	grief	therapy	.	kind	of	like	you	and	your	wild	-	goose	chase	.
you	take	her	with	you	and	...	look	at	the	ladies	.
if	it	makes	you	feel	any	better	,	he	did	n't	like	you	before	.
when	someone	close	to	you	dies	,	it	's	important	to	remember	them	,
if	i	do	n't	think	you	're	worthy	of	the	moral	sacrifice	i	made	.
i	do	n't	wanna	see	you	.	i	'm	so	mad	at	you	.
he	always	thought	it	was	a	real	shame	that	we	only	saw	the	suburbs	.
i	had	fun	reading	it	when	i	was	doing	the	proofs	.
and	it	'd	be	really	great	if	we	could	get	his	horse	in	the	picture	.
you	do	realize	i	'll	have	to	go	to	suffolk	to	file	.
half	an	hour	?	yeah	,	i	could	get	there	in	half	an	hour	.
too	many	.	we	'll	draw	for	it	.	give	me	a	number	.
we	'll	wait	a	few	minutes	.	i	'm	expecting	a	young	lady
and	my	wife	knew	how	it	was	from	the	smell	of	it	.
i	thought	it	would	help	her	.	you	people	.	you	get	off	the	highway
who	i	am	is	a	guy	with	a	house	on	the	hill	!
relocated	last	month	to	portland	from	seattle	...	no	priors	,	no	outstanding	.
think	about	it	.	he	never	even	looked	her	up	down	there	.
yeah	.	gave	me	some	good	ideas	-	well	,	one	,	anyway	.
well	,	it	's	our	job	to	get	to	the	truth	of	what	happened	.
all	freestanding	monument	signs	to	be	engineered	by	a	structural	engineer	to	match	local	code	requirements	and	wind	loads
i	have	the	solution	to	our	constant	shortfalls	of	source	water	.
do	you	think	for	one	instant	i	would	even	...	-	do	n't	feel	you	need	to	answer	right	away	.
you	ca	n't	even	keep	the	contracts	safe	.
after	a	mere	20	minutes	,	it	was	all	i	could	do	to	resist	dining	and	ditching	the	woman	.
and	it	's	not	only	safe	,	but	very	likely	more	safe	then	products	from	naturally	bred	livestock	.
georgie	-	boy	!	what	have	we	got	here	?
i	was	gon	na	ask	for	your	support	when	i	told	them	.
we	spent	the	next	15	years	building	our	beloved	home	:
declined	to	follow	me	back	to	new	york	,	but	-
i	'm	breaking	out	,	and	you	're	going	to	make	sure	my	brother	goes	with	me	.
number	of	children	.	she	wrote	three	,	crossed	it	out	and	wrote	two	.
fresh	snow	certainly	makes	following	animal	tracks	a	lot	easier	.
is	there	anything	you	would	like	to	say	?	my	lovely
these	non	-	smoking	rooms	are	located	on	the	2nd	floor	of	the	hotel	.
you	spend	a	lot	of	time	on	wikipedia	,	do	n't	you	?
you	got	metal	shardsin	your	hand	.	you	're	gushing	arterial	blood	.
but	do	n't	you	have	to	be	like	that	to	be	good	at	that	job	?
we	were	in	the	middle	of	an	operation	that	could	now	be	blown	.
have	you	ever	known	a	bad	omen	to	be	wrong	?
it	is	the	story	of	a	community	where	the	relationship
i	'm	not	the	one	giving	away	all	the	information	-
it	's	like	something	i	would	've	done	in	college	without	thinking	about	it	.
i	'm	telling	you	,	you	're	gon	na	order	the	goddamn	chicken	sandwich	.
he	was	trying	to	walk	away	,	but	the	baseball	player	-	he	followed	him	,	very	angry	.
prime	minister	nehru	was	the	latest	in	a	long	line
come	to	the	ghost	theater	,	the	ghost	theater	,	the	ghost	theater
i	need	you	to	stay	away	from	the	party	all	right	?
i	'm	asking	,	back	when	you	had	a	best	friend	named	tequila	,
write	down	part	of	what	you	wrote	on	the	note	.
what	did	you	just	say	?	-	what	did	you	just	say	?
harmless	?	are	you	crazy	?	it	can	wallow	in	one	second	.
yeah	!	i	mean	,	yeah	,	i	guess	i	could	hang	out	tonight	.
i	was	the	only	one	to	get	out	.	five	died	,	including	saunders	.
he	understands	that	life	is	unsteady	,	and	it	's	full	of	regret	and	fucking	recrimination	.
and	it	is	so	cute	how	she	signs	her	name	.
just	one	bite	.	it	's	okay	mom	.	i	have	to	go	.
i	do	n't	believe	for	a	second	that	woman	was	insane	.
do	n't	worry	about	it	.	let	's	get	him	out	to	the	audience	there	.
i	did	n't	fill	it	up	,	i	was	in	too	much	of	a	hurry	.
so	i	started	to	encourage	young	people	to	stand	up	for	themselves
you	're	gon	na	be	all	right	.	he	's	not	gon	na	hurt	you	anymore	.
but	i	see	a	cute	girl	sharing	a	room	with	three	boys
my	mom	got	murdered	,	and	you	move	her	into	our	house	and	tell	me	she	's	your	tenant	?
does	n't	matter	.	i	got	off	work	early	,	and	i	thought	we	could	get	ice	cream	.
i	got	a	bunch	of	new	games	i	think	you	might	like	.
if	the	truth	of	this	comes	out	,	it	could	shatter	people	's	faith	in	the	government	.
if	you	just	trust	me	,	i	promise	nothing	will	happen	to	you	.
uh	,	i	-	i	also	would	like	to	say	a	few	words	.
do	you	realize	how	much	mail	we	got	about	that	letter	?
soon	we	'll	have	you	attired	once	more	in	princely	finery
i	'm	researching	an	article	about	women	who	have	sex	like	men	.
if	you	make	her	appear	now	,	i	'll	buy	you	a	mighty	fine	drink	.
but	i	got	horns	that	open	bottles	and	i	got	horns	that	hold	my	keys
he	wanted	me	to	help	him	free	a	rebel	kryptonian	named	zod	.
and	a	beautiful	,	smart	girl	like	you	could	probably	get	any	guy	she	wants	.
because	you	're	in	pain	and	you	need	to	let	it	out	.
but	,	in	the	meantime	,	we	've	had	to	keep	her	restrained	.
i	do	n't	fancy	talking	and	keeping	my	eye	on	these	people	at	the	same	time	.
we	help	each	other	out	,	just	like	old	times	.
but	i	know	who	was	right	on	my	ass	all	the	way	to	the	car	.
but	if	you	force	me	to	spend	time	with	someone	you	will	probably	push	me	to	that	.
miss	schmidt	,	i	should	like	to	see	your	papers	please	.
this	a	bad	time	?	i	could	come	back	.	looks	like	some	real	dude	sweat	going	on	.
every	time	i	get	home	,	it	's	this	.	i	'm	sick	of	all	the	yelling	.
but	i	for	one	never	thought	that	it	would	come	to	this	.
hey	,	could	i	get	an	update	,	please	?	would	you	...	-	no	.	i	fired	you	.
i	still	am	quite	a	rock	'	n	'	roller	.	thanks	for	mentioning	that	.
now	i	have	had	soldiers	go	out	on	notification	and	break	into	a	stutter	.
let	's	see	what	kind	of	cards	they	're	holding	when	we	sit	down	at	the	table	,	all	right	?
to	charge	the	stage	like	that	,	and	save	my	life	.
if	no	one	backs	down	,	things	become	more	animated	.
oh	,	i	was	n't	.	i	said	i	would	be	in	the	.
take	i-95	north	to	exit	98	,	bear	right	off	exit	to	first	traffic	light	.
this	room	is	perfect	for	a	couple	of	friends	travelling	,	as	it	comes	with	two	extremely	soft	double	beds	.
i	just	know	.	you	looked	her	up	before	,	did	n't	you	?
the	president	felt	my	presence	would	be	sorely	missed	,	so	...
do	you	wanna	know	what	he	was	thinking	while	you	...
the	kind	of	force	that	could	've	occurred	when	the	gun	smashed	into	the	gargoyle	.
since	you	're	the	town	lawyer	,	so	do	you	.	what	's	up	?
do	you	think	they	have	anything	harder	than	this	bubbly	wine	?
we	should	do	a	barium	swallow	for	mallory	weiss	tears	,	start	her	on	nutritional	supplements	,	get	a	psych	consult	.
okay	,	yeah	,	this	whole	friendship	thing	,	it	's	not	going	to	work	.
you	said	it	was	my	film	.	i	do	n't	like	it	.	i	'm	taking	it	back	.
you	have	to	be	pushing	the	envelope	a	little	bit	more	.
i	'll	take	the	back	.	i	'll	meet	security	in	the	lobby	.
the	world	is	going	to	end	.	it	must	be	going	to	end	.
do	you	want	to	give	it	to	him	,	or	should	i	?
i	'm	not	sure	you	're	making	the	point	that	you	think	...
i	think	,	you	know	,	something	like	this	happens	,	you	just	...
still	over	a	thousand	planes	in	the	air	across	the	country	waiting	for	clearance	to	land	.
of	course	,	having	bone	cancer	was	like	being	the	titanic	and	the	iceberg	.
i	was	planning	to	suggest	a	new	world	theme	for	the	kennedys	.
grayson	's	a	better	lawyer	than	he	is	a	basketball	player	.
you	surrender	the	one	thing	you	never	have	and	you	never	will	,
it	's	going	well	,	thanks	to	you	.	i	'll	talk	to	you	later	.
if	you	're	going	to	wonder	,	let	's	go	down	and	do	it	over	a	steak	.
i	'll	do	a	search	on	things	like	medicine	and	juvenile	crime	-
that	i	'm	not	going	to	be	able	to	do	it	anymore	.
our	first	floor	suite	is	in	a	separate	building	,	with	one	queen	bed	,	lounge	and	kitchen	.
what	if	i	told	you	i	could	predict	the	future	?
go	,	you	crazy	son	of	a	bitch	.	go	.	he	's	on	the	warpath	.
i	know	.	clark	does	have	a	way	of	leaving	abruptly	.
do	you	have	any	ideas	what	the	scenes	are	gon	na	be	?
excuse	me	?	one	of	your	six	pathologists	,	which	ever	one	you	want	.
we	'll	start	at	the	far	end	and	we	'll	work	our	way	back	.
when	i	think	what	goes	on	in	the	minds	of	these	lice	,	i	wanna	vomit	!
oh	,	he	ca	n't	hack	the	military	?	oh	,	he	can	.	he	did	.
well	,	let	's	not	tell	the	taxpayers	what	we	're	doing	with	their	tax	dollars	.
i	'm	good	,	i	'm	fine	.	go	to	your	son	.	i	'm	good	.	i	'm	fine	.	go	.
oh	,	mother	,	i	wish	our	tess	had	n't	gone	to	be	a	lady	.
do	you	know	the	road	to	boulogne	-	sur	-	mer	?
had	his	car	repo'd	playing	scratch	-	n	-	wins	.
would	you	like	to	add	a	comment	?	turn	it	off	.
you	see	,	if	you	scrape	off	an	infected	skin	to	replace	it	,
would	be	benevolent	to	a	lesser	advanced	society	technologically	speaking
like	you	'd	expect	,	i	guess	.	i	feel	sorry	for	her	.
yes	,	just	kissing	the	bride	.	it	's	a	very	old	custom	.
well	,	i	'm	not	going	to	let	her	keep	this	parish	in	the	dark	ages	,
i	ca	n't	believe	i	never	got	my	something	that	has	to	stay	in	vegas	.
so	he	did	n't	come	up	behind	him	.	they	were	together	.
i	will	vouch	for	her	,	her	people	and	her	dragons	.
triad	sends	them	home	with	the	intent	that	when	they	're	grown
if	they	're	not	going	to	rescue	the	prince	,	why	are	they	here	?
we	ca	n't	hope	to	hold	all	this	.	we	have	to	pull	in	,	concentrate	.
but	i	had	a	feeling	jimmy	was	trying	to	sense	if	i	'd	rat	on	him	to	save	my	neck	.
so	i	'm	glad	that	we	came	home	before	we	both	did	something	we	'd	regret	.
if	you	think	it	'll	help	,	the	drugs	will	help	.	power	of	the	mind	.
i	'm	talking	about	beats	you	would	n't	even	believe	.	all	right	?

this	is	the	tribal	chief	on	tv	!	the	,	uh	-
i	appreciate	you	coming	,	though	.	know	it	could	n't	have	been	easy	.
but	i	think	it	's	impossible	that	he	had	the	nerve	to	do	it	.
i	knew	i	'd	seen	him	.	he	's	here	.	he	's	in	the	station	.
he	wanted	it	to	be	one	of	his	numbered	symphonies	.
a	couple	days	later	,	some	of	the	jewelry	ended	up	missing	.
this	man	could	n't	even	get	his	family	to	eat	dinner	together	.
but	she	was	keeping	in	her	wallet	the	idea	that	some	people
he	's	determined	to	get	his	hands	on	this	exhibition	right	from	the	start
and	i	-	i	ca	n't	let	her	keep	my	child	.
but	if	the	cop	ever	discovers	the	truth	,	we	're	done	for	,	you	hear	?
even	they	do	n't	have	a	right	to	break	a	heart	.

he	lost	his	computer	,	he	needs	it	.	they	went	off	frantic	to	find	it	.
i	heard	noises	noises	,	i	was	afraid	they	would	come	back	to	finish	me	off	.
including	a	little	something	i	like	to	call	bovine	serum	albumin	.
you	know	,	you	really	have	nothing	to	be	embarrassed	about	.	and	i	can	verify	that	personally	.

i	made	calls	about	you	.	you	were	cia	's	wonder	boy	until	...
but	i	also	intend	to	push	for	improved	foreign	relations	and	the	restoration	of	civil	liberties
it	is	only	now	beginning	to	suspect	that	the	survivors
i	...	i	...	i	spend	thousands	of	dollars	on	a	cake	,	a	caterer	and	flowers	.
this	next	issue	is	something	special	.	it	's	one	of	my	personal	favorites	.
how	many	partners	have	you	had	in	the	last	month	?
the	only	thing	better	than	blowing	up	$	100	billion	worth	of	gold	is	making	people	think	you	did	.
but	he	also	happens	to	be	on	a	hot	streak	right	now	,
i	did	not	know	the	girl	,	never	found	the	girl

and	he	's	made	seven	phone	calls	to	bagad	in	the	last	month	,
i	'm	supposed	to	just	sit	back	and	let	people	figure	it	out	.
but	the	point	is	,	that	little	girl	is	in	the	midst	of	a	massive	spiritual	crisis	.
he	has	fernando	sucre	pulled	over	outside	of	latrobe	,	pennsylvania	.
i	'll	see	you	soon	,	michael	,	it	may	be	sooner	than	you	think	,
we	should	n't	even	be	here	,	we	should	be	at	home	.
because	we	know	each	other	's	secrets	and	know	each	other	's	desires
sir	,	my	wife	is	very	frugal	.	she	saves	out	of	the	house	keeping	money	.
i	'll	be	ready	to	take	on	scene	command	in	three	,	two	,	one	.	i	'm	in	charge	.
because	about	ten	years	ago	he	made	a	decision	that	cost	him	his	practice	.
i	'm	going	to	-	i	'm	going	to	do	bad	things	to	you	.
phase	two	,	introduction	of	new	dna	,	harvested	from	healthy	donors	.

you	'll	know	when	it	's	safe	to	make	a	pickup	,	when	it	's	not	.

now	,	getting	back	to	the	problem	at	hand	,	what	to	do	with	a	washed	-	up	experimental	physicist	...

it	's	really	a	mixed	feeling	in	the	air	.	she	's	finally	free	,
if	i	was	back	at	home	and	i	played	a	show	,

well	,	that	's	the	game	plan	.	you	better	make	sure	you	win	.
if	there	's	any	chance	of	reconnecting	with	them	,	we	'd	better	get	moving	.
if	you	'd	applied	yourself	to	anything	other	than	your	chosen	profession	,
so	,	i	mean	...	i	want	to	check	a	few	more	things	.
he	'll	be	waiting	to	find	out	.	then	meet	us	here	.
that	ability	to	look	into	a	situation	beyond	the	obvious

if	you	pursue	this	any	further	,	i	'm	gon	na	have	to	throw	you	out	of	the	cbi	.
because	when	our	children	go	bad	,	our	dreams	get	flushed	down	with	them	.
shopping	in	old	town	scottsdale	is	a	real	treat	,	and	the	arts	district	always	has	something	happening	.

but	when	you	're	married	with	three	kids	,	you	got	no	time	for	that	.
and	do	n't	you	go	talking	to	me	like	that	.	i	'm	not	your	kid	!
as	a	matter	of	fact	,	i	think	that	this	is	the	beginning	of	a	beautiful	friendship	...
i	came	here	to	have	a	body	check	-	up	for	you
i	got	ta	get	over	to	her	house	.	i	miss	her	.
these	are	matters	of	the	rivers	and	lakes	and	the	paparazzi	are	interested	?

he	used	to	work	for	the	people	who	wanted	me	dead	.
to	get	a	good	picture	of	the	pirate	in	front	of	grauman	's	chinese	theatre	.
can	i	-	can	i	do	something	for	you	?
the	unanimous	attitude	of	the	adult	's	had	to	be	the	consequence

i	'll	tell	you	one	thing	blondie	.	if	i	knew	that	my	last	hour	had	come	...
my	friends	at	court	will	not	allow	this	.	the	queen	herself	...
you	're	really	loving	this	,	you	bastard	!	all	right	,	calm	yourselves	.
somewhere	i	can	flee	from	easily	,	like	napa	or	palm	springs	.
i	do	n't	rattle	,	kid	.	but	just	for	that	,	i	'm	going	to	beat	you	flat	!
i	hope	you	two	can	get	past	this	,	but	if	you	ca	n't	and	you	need	someone	to	talk	to	,
but	i	guess	the	past	has	n't	settled	accounts	with	me	.
but	i	'm	afraid	the	darkest	hours	of	hell	lie	before	you	.
if	you	convince	him	to	buy	,	will	you	steer	him	my	way	?
a	few	years	ago	,	these	asshole	mexicans	dumped	me	into	a	grave	.
well	,	you	could	do	that	or	,	you	could	let	me	do	your	hair	,
what	kind	of	monster	would	do	this	?	i	'm	so	sorry	.
these	rooms	have	free	internet	access	(	via	lan	)	,	a	mini	-	bar	,	32	-	inch	flat	-	screen	tv	and	phone	.

we	see	someone	in	trouble	and	we	wish	we	could	help	,
i	refuse	to	hustle	.	i	want	to	lead	you	down	the	path	of	ovid	and	sappho	.
and	what	did	n't	fit	in	the	rv	,	we	towed	in	the	car	.
i	ca	n't	undo	it	and	put	everything	back	into	piles	.
well	,	sure	.	what	do	you	think	i	am	,	some	asshole	?
then	you	should	have	chosen	cromer	rather	than	south	end	.
i	had	to	hit	him	with	the	shoes	,	what	else	could	i	do	?
oh	!	you	're	a	miracle	worker	.	how	did	you	do	that	?
fadela	's	within	30	feet	of	us	.	see	if	you	can	find	her	.

i	have	spent	my	life	making	things	that	bring	joy	and	happiness	,

and	i	know	that	that	's	about	you	,	but
let	's	have	a	look	around	.	there	's	three	bedrooms	,	a	gourmet	kitchen
i	hereby	order	you	to	serve	two	life	sentences	back	to	back
fits	of	spatial	disorientation	,	as	if	the	earth	had	opened	under	him	.
i	know	it	seems	hopeless	,	but	you	wo	n't	always	be	around	to	protect	him	.
we	live	in	reality	.	come	back	to	the	other	side	.
oh	,	of	course	.	you	know	it	all	.	he	was	one	of	my	heroes	.

well	,	i	guess	i	'm	just	going	to	have	to	enjoy	this
you	are	looking	a	little	flushed	.	do	you	want	me	to	...	?
it	's	quite	amazing	,	it	's	really	complex	the	way	that	these	defences	are	integrated	in	the	one	gate	.
in	the	bathroom	you	will	find	an	assisted	bathtub	that	takes	the	work	out	of	a	relaxing	soak	.
so	,	i	thought	,	hey	,	let	's	put	a	few	bucks	into	it	,	you	know	?
so	i	just	need	to	talk	to	her	really	fast
i	could	tell	you	of	his	hands	,	of	his	eyes	.

i	'm	sure	that	the	music	you	like	is	no	longer	the	kind	i	like	.
from	aspens	,	spruce	and	other	trees	,	both	conifers	and	deciduous	.
it	's	worth	mentioning	,	by	the	way	,	that	augustus	'	taste	,	even	in	villas	,	was	somewhat	more	modest	than	tiberius	.
look	,	i	've	gone	along	with	every	crazy	idea	you	've	ever	had	.
that	coming	through	the	probie	class	right	now	is	a	black	kid	,
you	know	,	the	new	generation	of	players	are	smarter	now	.
i	mean	,	if	you	knew	him	,	you	'd	know	he	does	n't	take	risks	.

and	we	'll	have	to	cook	it	,	unless	he	orders	something	cold	.
syd	,	this	border	guard	i	sell	pot	to	,	has	agreed	to	get	us	into	bexhill	.

since	when	do	you	give	a	fuck	about	a	communion	?
spa	available	,	japanese	bubble	tubs	for	two	in	some	suites
who	stole	it	from	the	crown	of	the	empress	dowager
sniff	out	an	air	-	conditioning	unit	like	an	old	bloodhound	bitch	.
two	guys	talking	about	women	,	the	weather	and	such	.	you	got	it	?
that	's	what	i	called	you	,	and	i	'll	fucking	kill	you	!
you	'd	better	treat	them	well	if	you	want	respect	from	them	.
and	if	the	tables	were	turned	,	she	would	have	done	something	way	worse	to	me	.
sometimes	i	can	yank	them	out	before	the	muffin	monster	chews	them	to	shit	.
you	're	playing	the	male	lead	in	a	homage	to	william	shakespeare	's
surface	mounted	displays	should	only	be	used	when	it	is	not	structurally	possible	to	use	recessed	enclosures
do	n't	do	this	.	you	do	n't	want	to	turn	your	back	on	your	child	.
tiny	door	mirrors	so	it	cuts	through	the	air	with	barely	a	ripple	.
i	do	n't	see	a	case	here	.	well	,	i	did	n't	,	either	,
why	do	you	think	it	's	had	such	an	inspirational	effect	on	people	?
oh	,	hey	.	i	did	n't	think	i	was	gon	na	get	you	.
hey	-	o	!	if	you	damage	any	of	my	data	,	you	will	not	come	within	an	inch

so	much	that	he	took	a	pair	of	her	panties	as	a	souvenir	.
my	sister	and	i	used	to	play	four	handed	pieces	.
what	a	relief	it	is	to	talk	you	do	n't	know	.
you	have	n't	been	sleeping	well	.	yes	,	but	i	already	told	the	nurse	.
you	'd	better	go	out	into	the	garden	and	wait	around	the	back	of	the	house	.
but	it	's	my	job	as	your	sergeant	to	lead	the	way	.
yes	,	it	was	,	uh	,	some	play	that	had	to	do	with	art	...
but	we	're	still	waiting	on	the	werewolf	hairs	.	i	'll	keep	you	in	the	loop	.
yeah	.	that	's	one	way	to	deal	with	being	a	walking	plague

if	he	's	going	to	die	,	then	he	'd	better	do	it
take	the	stuffing	out	of	the	refrigerator	and	put	it	in	the	turkey	.
well	,	this	upright	chap	certainly	enjoyed	patronizing	some	dodgy	women	.
i	understand	you	ca	n't	conduct	deadly	experiments	on	other	peoples	'	kids	to	save	your	own	.
let	's	see	if	we	can	get	cat	barbie	to	like	me	.

for	once	in	your	life	,	jen	,	i	think	you	're	right	.

i	'm	sure	if	she	knew	how	bad	it	was	,	she	would	come	down	.
from	afghanistan	in	the	east	to	libya	in	the	west	.
although	what	that	means	varies	depending	on	what	kind	of	a	problem	it	is	.

upstairs	,	at	the	foyer	,	we	almost	bumped	into	each	other	.
the	only	way	three	people	can	keep	a	secret	is	if	two	of	them	are	dead	,
little	man	like	you?if	you	get	real	good	,	we	could	make	some	serious	scrilla	.
when	i	was	a	child	,	i	would	've	been	way	more	afraid	of	my	father	than	of	going	to	sleep	.
that	's	why	we	did	n't	find	a	bullet	in	the	victim	.
i	'd	rather	sleep	100	nights	outside	than	one	night	in	that	creepy	place	.
the	only	thing	to	do	with	them	is	to	seize	them	,

go	get	him	.	i	'll	come	visit	you	in	your	cabin	up	state	.
and	forgive	us	our	sins	,	as	we	forgive	those	that	sin	against	us	.

yeah	,	for	you	,	it	's	clowns	.	for	me	,	it	's	old	dead	guys	.
i	have	club	soda	.	it	's	a	-	a	gift	from	the	gods	.	it	's	like	an	eraser	.
i	know	you	're	hurt	,	but	you	're	the	one	who	took	the	job	as	my	boss	at	"	mode	"	.
there	's	no	way	i	can	go	out	without	him	or	his	nigger
so	every	little	piece	,	even	the	smallest	piece	,	are	saved	,
well	,	the	good	news	is	he	wo	n't	be	bitching	about	losing	his	hand	if	he	ca	n't	breathe	.
and	back	in	the	room	there	was	more	bad	news	.
but	make	it	strong	,	honey	.	do	n't	be	stingy	.	with	lemon	.
you	think	it	's	already	done	?	they	asked	me	to	tell	them	who	i	'd	bring	in	,
if	he	was	same	as	i	think	,	i	'll	kill	him	.
we	have	that	opportunity	because	we	have	signed	a	treaty	.
what	's	happening	?	well	,	i	told	you	i	had	n't	quite	got	it	right	.
and	we	just	had	word	that	authorities	are	considering	sending	in	the	first	relief	team	.
i	put	it	in	a	very	safe	mutual	fund	that	will	pay	him	dividends	each	month	.
a	lot	of	pumped	-	up	men	taking	their	clothes	off	.
i	told	you	she	was	n't	a	bella	.	-	aubrey	,	do	n't	.
may	i	please	speak	to	my	mother	?	-	who	is	this	?
i	know	i	wo	n't	end	up	like	you	!	she	's	the	reason	i	'm	here	.
you	take	a	turn	typing	this	shit	and	i	'll	go	with	him	.
across	the	street	from	safeway	24	-	hour	supermarket	,	full	service	,	american	,	open	for	:	breakfast	,	lunch	,	dinner
you	're	such	an	optimist	to	believe	that	in	a	world
it	's	really	great	when	big	business	and	government	work	so	closely	together	.
he	likes	the	town	,	paints	toy	soldiers	,	and	he	's	gay	.
every	frame	of	it	.	why	do	you	think	we	came	back	?
a	merger	between	two	u.s	.	oil	companies	is	taking	place	in	houston	.
mistrustful	,	shallow	old	man	who	has	always	been	jealous	of	his	brother	.
and	the	quicker	we	find	that	case	,	the	quicker	i	'll	let	you	forget	it	.
no	,	no	,	no	.	actually	,	i	do	n't	think	those	pants	are	too	dressy	at	all	,
and	there	i	was	thinking	i	was	saving	the	world	,	mate	.
i	heard	it	all	,	dummy	!	you	got	picked	over	crabs	.
uh	,	well	,	there	was	a	dead	girl	in	the	bathtub	.
i	know	my	way	around	a	lady	's	sweater	.	do	you	?
just	because	he	's	a	jerk	does	n't	mean	i	have	to	be	a	jerk
oh	,	oh	,	oh	...	you	're	gon	na	want	to	put	this	on	.
be	sure	to	inquire	about	packages	to	help	make	the	most	of	your	stay	.
i	'm	sorry	we	had	to	stop	by	like	this	,	but	we	really	need	to	talk	to	you	about	something	.
but	in	my	room	,	i	'd	miss	out	on	all	the	ambience	.
well	,	if	that	's	how	you	feel	,	then	i	was	kidding	.
i	think	he	misses	you	more	than	you	can	imagine	.
when	i	gave	her	the	picture	,	she	started	to	cry	.
and	you	chain	him	to	the	cross	just	before	dawn	.
who	can	bring	out	the	scientific	mind	in	all	of	them	.
in	a	topsy	-	turvy	world	where	nothing	is	as	it	seems	,
you	want	to	move	up	the	food	chain	?	you	need	a	lion	's	share	.
oh	,	i	did	n't	get	it	,	not	like	store	-	bought	get	it	.
the	only	ones	who	are	gon	na	tell	me	when	i	'm	through	doing	my	thing	...
they	do	n't	know	who	they	are	or	where	they	're	going	.
have	you	got	a	dog	?	-	i	-	i	do	have	a	dog	,	yes	.
he	does	n't	get	out	of	there	alive	.	fine	with	me	.
you	're	at	home	,	and	i	have	no	idea	what	happened	.
bad	things	happen	,	and	it	just	makes	me	feel	better	to	be	prepared	when	they	do	.
well	done	,	lads	.	-	move	it	faster	,	mate	.	too	slow	!
two	weeks	later	,	it	blows	up	a	government	building	in	the	philippines	.
i	took	her	to	a	plastic	surgeon	in	chicago	'cause	i	did	n't	want	her	to	feel	self	-	conscious	.
i	do	think	that	you	both	better	get	your	solos	ready	.
professor	.	at	last	.	it	's	really	an	honor	to	see	you	again	.
you	'll	get	shot	if	you	do	n't	run	faster	than	that	!
which	,	by	the	way	,	looks	nothing	at	all	like	paradise	.
headache	,	eye	pain	,	vision	impairment	-	you	need	to	call	me	immediately	.
i	decided	not	to	leave	and	here	i	plan	to	stay	,
and	stay	true	in	the	face	of	danger	and	death	?
i	was	at	your	apartment	.	i	tried	the	starbucks	on	lexington	.
and	i	do	n't	want	you	to	think	that	i	had	it	in	for	the	guy	.
i	hope	this	will	give	you	a	little	bit	of	comfort	.
captain	,	i	do	n't	have	time	for	this	.	where	did	this	bomb	come	from	?
i	mean	,	wo	n't	i	get	a	lot	of	money	from	the	sale	?
i	was	too	old	for	her	,	and	i	never	saw	her	again	.
on	this	planet	you	would	be	suffering	from	extra	gravity	.
oh	,	by	the	way	,	there	was	another	booby	trap	in	that	building	.
do	you	think	that	she	is	in	love	with	you	?
okay	,	you	know	the	guy	who	owns	this	place	,	he	has	a	monkey	.
i	told	you	-	we	throw	him	down	a	,	down	an	old
but	,	you	know	,	i	'm	a	guy	.	i	understand	career	goals	.
he	was	my	stooge	in	junior	high	if	anyone	bothers	you	...
free	breakfast	with	fresh	baked	waffles	and	yogurt	,	high	-	speed	internet
that	's	the	best	place	in	the	world	to	be	,	in	the	tube	.
but	,	yes	,	and	i	can	tell	you	it	is	great	to	finally	be	popular	.
it	does	n't	matter	why	,	you	're	not	teaching	maths	,	are	you	?
that	if	he	did	not	return	,	i	would	tell	his	parents	what	had	happened	?
why	do	n't	we	go	back	to	the	office	?	you	can	polygraph	me	.
from	her	dressing	room	and	is	making	way	up	here	to	the	octagon	.
the	thumb	is	responsible	for	40	%	of	hand	function	.	without	it	,	we	're	done	.
of	your	daughter	,	taken	at	an	event	last	week	-	wearing	not	only	a	stolen	dress	,
point	is	,	you	do	n't	have	to	go	to	africa	to	hunt	wild	game	anymore	.	if	you	've	got	e	money	,
i	show	you	what	tape	measure	can	do	to	flesh	.
and	i	hate	myself	for	it	,	because	my	personal	motto	is	,
if	i	get	all	hot	and	bothered	,	there	's	no	stopping	me	.
i	just	-	growing	up	,	we	had	this	rule	-	no	religion	,	politics	or	sex	at	the	table	.
i	think	i	can	take	this	guy	.	are	you	insane	?
when	i	saw	your	father	,	i	-	i	saw	not	honor	.
there	will	be	plenty	of	funds	in	the	war	chest	after	our	german	booby	loses	tonight	.
did	you	know	that	over	98	%	of	people	will	respond	with	thank	you	if	you	say	,	you	're	welcome	?
it	's	a	pity	he	ca	n't	marry	her	now	.	at	least	,	there	'd	be	one	less	mouth	to	feed	.
it	's	very	important	that	i	speak	to	her	.	it	's	urgent	!
allahu	akbar	,	allahu	akbar	.	why	are	we	on	the	same	bus	?
based	on	the	perspective	,	would	n't	this	be	like	a	flanking	panel	to	maybe	the	central	one	?
for	something	we	both	believe	in	?	this	is	n't	that	simple	.
yeah	.	but	what	if	you	end	up	in	the	same	place	?
we	'll	give	it	everything	we	've	got	.	tell	me	i	did	n't	just	say	that	.
i	'm	of	a	certain	age	,	people	expect	you	to	get	married	.
if	somebody	did	introduce	that	stuff	through	the	filtration	system	,	it	would	've	taken	hours	.
was	that	on	one	side	the	loop	looked	like	it	was	corroded	.
only	the	time	and	location	of	the	next	drop	.	which	is	n't	until	next	week	.
but	i	need	someone	to	keep	the	state	police	and	the	national	guard	from	bumping	in	to	each	other	.
at	night	you	will	sleep	in	utter	comfort	atop	the	comfy	queen	bed	.
you	know	how	i	was	always	the	best	at	being	single	?
i	can	win	because	i	have	more	ambition	and	more	motivation
what	we	're	saying	is	,	it	's	been	a	long	day	already	,
he	was	in	the	mob	,	but	yet	he	wanted	you	to	be	a	hero	.
he	hates	your	career	because	of	mom	.	mom	had	a	singer	songwriter	friend	.
we	know	you	had	nothing	to	do	with	hiding	the	body	.
acids	in	your	hand	could	damage	it	.	we	want	it	to	last	forever	.
so	the	way	to	play	this	game	is	to	equalize	the	piles	.
the	tiffin	wallahs	carry	the	lunches	across	a	busy	road	to	be	sorted	.
we	create	an	environment	where	you	and	your	friends	can	feel	at	home	.
if	we	split	up	,	we	re	gon	na	...	stay	with	joey	.
i	'll	get	my	bathing	trunks	.	meet	you	in	the	lobby	.
i	thought	my	days	of	worrying	about	you	were	over	.	what	happened	?
and	i	saved	that	note	in	my	room	at	the	very	back	of	my	desk	drawer	.
we	have	to	hand	it	to	our	federal	agents	here	.
i	'm	going	to	run	home	and	get	our	receipts	and	a	calculator	.
who	did	it	?	i	knew	you	were	gon	na	victimize	me	,	man	.
what	are	you	d	-	i	thought	-	sorry	.	i	thought	there	was	a	moment	there	.
i	found	them	by	accident	,	hidden	inside	one	of	those	two	pianos	.
to	go	to	a	tax	-	free	state	and	end	up	selling	your	business
i	actually	moved	out	here	to	play	triple	a	ball	with	the	beavers	...
only	she	was	too	far	gone	to	do	anything	about	it	.
you	can	just	change	the	reservation	to	your	name	,	if	you	want	.
i	do	n't	handle	this	sort	of	thing	well	at	all	.
can	you	come	to	the	site	with	me	this	afternoon	?
i	am	so	sorry	,	senor	.	i	will	deal	with	this	personally	.
over	the	last	27	years	,	oscars	for	make	-	up	have	been	awarded	to	artists
for	i	'm	in	the	humor	to	.	does	me	good	to	hear	you	.
we	're	back	on	the	fifth	.	should	we	just	do	it	then	?
meaning	they	do	n't	see	any	of	their	employees	as	being	culpable	.
it	was	laid	down	by	my	father	.	what	say	we	open	one	,	eh	?
and	i	can	make	another	casserole	.	-	yeah	,	'cause	he	has	n't	suffered	enough	.
a	lot	of	dresses	,	a	lot	of	colors	.	so	what	?
and	she	asked	me	to	keep	an	eye	on	him	.
you	need	to	get	out	of	the	street	.	watch	out	!
do	n't	blow	this	out	of	proportion	,	it	's	not	that	big	of	a	deal	,	right	?
of	the	community	to	in	fact	feel	the	feeling	in	the	first	place	.
so	a	large	back	-	up	team	is	needed	in	the	ecosystem	,
but	i	got	a	long	road	tomorrow	.	i	need	to	sleep	.
i	flew	with	the	membership	fee	from	the	alumni	association	.
is	n't	it	amazing	?	and	our	kids	are	all	grown	up	now	.
book	like	this	could	really	take	her	little	imprint	to	the	next	level	.
mr	.	cable	,	do	you	feel	that	this	lawsuit	is	frivolous	?
well	,	he	's	not	going	to	talk	because	he	'd	implicate	himself	.
for	the	allergy	i	have	but	never	told	you	guys	about	.
great	.	this	is	a	really	good	move	.	yeah	.	really	good	.
ok	,	let	me	just	say	my	story	all	the	way	through
who	let	these	prisoners	into	the	yard	,	this	is	supposed	to	be	a	locked	hour	.
i	seem	to	have	lost	an	integral	part	of	my	plan	.
it	is	really	important	that	this	dress	totally	works	.
but	i	dedicated	a	song	to	her	at	the	ninth	grade	talent	show	.
we	have	eyes	on	the	northeast	corner	of	the	town
of	what	is	turning	out	to	be	the	most	horrific	crime	scene
it	's	actually	kind	of	boring	.	-	no	,	no	.	i	...	it	's	...
i	just	need	one	.	you	see	the	girls	around	here	?
it	gets	us	into	his	head	.	beyond	that	,	i	do	n't	really	know	.
completely	in	due	diligence	,	but	i	can	tell	you	for	sure	,
i	'd	be	much	less	nervous	if	it	was	a	date	.
so	that	's	how	tommy	started	the	thing	called	the	battle	zone	.
okay	,	i	'm	starting	to	feel	exposed	here	.	i	think	i	'm	going	to	move	.

no	,	i	do	n't	think	so	.	'cause	i	have	a	list	too	.
if	this	is	goodbye	,	thanks	for	trying	set	me	straight	.
i	've	remortgaged	twice	.	not	just	i	suppose	for	the	dancing	,

he	's	not	my	friend	.	why	'd	he	ask	for	you	,	then	?
i	have	n't	had	one	for	long	,	a	few	months	,	but	i	'll	tell	you	...
as	a	plea	to	the	gods	to	end	a	severe	drought	.
to	have	everybody	you	ever	met	park	on	this	shoulder	.
and	on	the	way	you	're	gon	na	pass	a	pig	eating	a	bear	claw	.
do	i	have	to	point	out	that	this	is	not	a	baby	?
so	will	he	,	if	you	believe	the	old	testament	.	who	killed	her	?
oh	.	you	will	be	exploited	,	your	story	wo	n't	be	told	truthfully	,
i	wanna	talk	to	you	about	an	opportunity	we	should	run	with	.

if	delilah	does	n't	care	,	what	are	we	so	riled	up	about	?
maybe	you	did	kill	somebody	.	should	we	turn	on	the	news	and	see	?
is	that	what	you	thought	?	-	i	will	not	be	bullied	.
ok	!	in	fact	,	just	tell	me	the	story	,	i	would	believe	anything	.
yeah	,	when	i	say	.	"	get	off	me	,	you	crazy	bitch	"	,
i	know	you	probably	do	n't	wanna	hear	from	me	after	thanksgiving	.
i	'm	sorry	to	interrupt	,	mr	.	rearden	.	there	's	an	urgent	call	on	line	two	.
does	it	always	have	to	be	me	?	i	'm	afraid	it	does	.
you	think	he	just	climbed	that	big	ol'tree	all	by	himself	?
i	never	took	it	seriously	until	i	walk	in	the	room	,	and	she	's	laying	there	....
and	since	i	'm	all	about	quid	pro	quo	,	you	might	want	to	check	out	a	mirror	.
i	was	with	jody	farr	,	from	about	three	in	the	afternoon
and	he	does	n't	know	why	he	did	the	things	he	did	.
all	right	.	did	they	say	they	were	gon	na	press	any	charges	?
why	did	you	proceed	with	the	funeral	arrangements	without	telling	us	?

so	why	does	he	need	to	attend	a	mosque	in	i.	a.	unless	he	's	been	...
hello	.	i	'm	pat	healy	.	i	'm	lyle	watson	.	this	is	arthur	cabot	.

how	many	days	has	she	been	ill	?	five	,	five	days	,	pops	.
i	'm	heading	out	.	you	two	are	gon	na	wash	the	bathrooms	,	right	?
yep	,	you	are	just	as	stubborn	as	this	one	over	here	.
the	only	thing	that	i	know	is	that	my	copies	want	him	dead	.
hello	geum	-	ok	!	i	know	you	'll	become	a	very	famous	writer	.
things	were	unraveling	between	the	two	of	you	,	and	suddenly	you	're	pregnant	,	so	i	ended	it	.
it	occurred	to	my	mother	though	.	god	,	i	hate	that	she	was	right	.
if	you	do	n't	grab	hold	of	it	now	,	then	i	do	n't	think	you	deserve	to	win	the	show	.
bring	her	in	.	arrest	her	if	you	have	to	.	put	her	in	a	safe	house	.
i	've	given	16	years	of	my	life	to	this	company	.
was	moving	,	it	did	n't	seem	to	create	a	crater	of	a	size
arm	photons	.	prepare	to	fire	on	the	klingon	war	birds	.
and	this	morning	you	told	me	about	the	bread	going	mouldy	.
you	know	,	first	time	i	ever	even	did	an	open	mic	,	it	was	here	.
do	n't	let	's	argue	,	alec	.	this	evening	was	meant	to	please	you	.
and	even	though	some	were	feeling	under	the	weather	,	they	came	out	on	top	of	their	game	.
i	can	split	them	.	but	by	using	yourself	as	bait	?
so	now	you	wo	n't	have	to	leave	starbucks	to	enjoy	starbucks	in	your	starbucks	.
i	hope	you	like	the	skin	cream	.	i	had	it	specially	made	for	you	.
you	poured	a	glass	of	wine	,	you	had	some	popcorn	...
oh	.	well	,	you	gave	it	your	best	shot	.	circle	of	life	and	all	that	.
if	i	'm	not	mistaken	,	this	was	built	in	82	,	which	means	the	plumbishaftway	should	have	ample	room	.
like	i	do	n't	have	problems	enough	trying	to	keep	on	his	right	side	.
if	he	plays	it	cool	.	hit	and	run	.	stall	and	retreat	.
i	can	get	you	reinstated	,	but	i	need	to	know	now	:	is	that	what	you	want	?
to	put	the	chains	on	your	gorillas	for	the	next	few	months	.
come	on	!	there	's	got	ta	be	a	way	to	crack	this	thing	!
yes	,	the	german	troops	are	here	.	in	half	an	hour	we	'll	surround

stay	in	a	clean	,	well	-	appointed	guest	room	or	unique	suite	equipped	with	wireless	high	-	speed	internet	and	cable	satellite	television	.
okay	.	that	way	,	you	can	just	stack	shit	all	over	the	house	,
that	have	powerful	contra	-	indicators	.	you	mean	drug	interactions	?
we	do	n't	do	this	now	,	we	wo	n't	have	an	economy	on	monday	.
and	i	had	a	gun	,	but	i	could	n't	pull	the	trigger	.
when	i	meet	with	the	tattaglia	people	,	should	i	insist	...
that	i	'm	the	neighborhood	-	watch	captain	for	my	block	,
i	hear	the	fat	kid	running	.
you	do	n't	want	to	take	the	ship	.	you	want	to	destroy	it	.
and	i	will	do	it	again	,	if	you	do	n't	get	in	this	car	right	now	.
i	've	heard	that	song	a	million	times	.	i	do	n't	think	i	've	ever	heard	it	until	tonight	.

we	can	do	this	.	we	just	got	to	stick	together	.
handicrafts	sometimes	are	unique	so	that	they	're	of	great	value	.
yeah	,	i	was	,	but	now	i	'm	not	and	i	need	you	to	go	now	.
she	told	me	i	'm	gon	na	die	this	week	,	so	i	'm	bummed	.

so	,	i	'll	see	you	when	you	close	then	.	can	we	go	out	for	coffee	?
3	cocktails	in	,	i	am	looking	at	second	base	,	so	this	better	be	good	.
you	have	the	reporter	at	noon	and	i	think	you	're	gon	na	like	her	a	lot	.
uh	,	i	do	n't	know	if	they	did	,	really	.	right	,	okay	.
you	know	what	,	nina	?	you	're	right	.	i	do	n't	really	wanna	just	sit	here	and	wait	to	die	.
it	is	the	best	place	to	spot	you	when	i	exit	.
you	think	the	president	will	defend	us	on	nuclear	power	.
i	never	let	myself	have	dreams	like	that	.	i	mean	,	what	's	the	point	?
the	most	successful	occupier	down	in	a	tent	on	the	street	.
that	's	why	i	'm	arranging	protection	for	you	back	at	the	base	.
it	's	a	weird	symbol	,	so	i	do	n't	know	what	it	stand	for	.
three	shovels	,	two	pick	-	axes	,	500	rounds	of	ammunition	and	,	uh	...
an	obscure	roman	inventor	and	engineer	.	helped	build	these	baths	.
he	worked	in	the	hospital	lab	.	this	is	more	fun	.
so	what	's	it	gon	na	be	come	and	play	with	my	begonias	?
a	man	has	got	to	learn	the	difference	between	just	plain	liars	...
it	's	like	knows	where	we	're	going	and	what	we	're	thinking	.
wow	,	that	makes	this	lady	the	closest	thing	to	have	back	down	we	've	got	.
you	want	me	to	help	you	get	yourself	a	real	sweet	...
it	's	just	-	it	sounds	a	little	crazy	,	is	all	.
any	messages	you	were	exchanging	will	show	up	in	the	log	.
i	've	been	housebound	for	the	last	year	.	how	claustrophobic	could	i	be	?
i	'm	going	to	come	up	and	get	the	first	aid	kit	from	the	truck	.
there	's	only	one	way	you	get	to	go	up	in	this	thing	.
15	years	in	special	ops	,	interrogating	,	tracking	,	climbing	into	caves	in	afghanistan	.
no	,	i	never	agreed	to	kill	someone	.	-	yes	,	you	did	!
well	i	ai	n't	had	key	lime	pie	in	ten	years	.
so	he	banks	some	of	it	in	case	of	emergency	.
there	's	so	much	i	want	to	know	.	when	did	you	get	back	?
i	'm	hoping	to	see	her	liver	and	kidney	function	improve	.
we	'll	do	whatever	we	can	to	help	.	i	appreciate	that	.
that	everything	was	made	from	earth	,	fire	,	air	and	water	,
but	if	we	can	figure	out	what	he	does	want	,
hey	,	wait	a	minute	.	think	you	have	some	explaining	to	do	.
if	we	did	n't	stand	our	ground	when	delivering	the	money	,
we	promised	each	other	we	would	n't	lie	to	each	other	.
he	'd	have	no	reason	to	kill	either	one	of	them	.
he	's	highly	intelligent	,	but	he	holds	a	menial	or	low	-	level	job	.
i	just	-	i	-	i	-	i	figured	you	'd	be	working	.
um	,	i	just	,	i	really	need	you	to	get	back	to	me
he	was	n't	a	great	pilot	.	as	a	matter	of	fact	,
and	how	i	'd	rather	drive	to	the	end	of	the	block	than	walk	.
because	if	dignity	consists	and	be	governed	by	a	law	that	i	give	myself	,
the	best	western	savoy	hotel	with	114	comfortable	rooms	is	located	directly	in	the	city	center	.
when	he	decided	to	have	the	senior	partners	over	to	his	new	apartment	for	dinner	.
there	are	powerful	things	out	there	that	none	of	us	can	understand	.
yes	,	but	he	's	only	in	the	first	,	not	the	second	photo	,	which	was	clearly	taken	on	another	day	.
i	and	this	bitch	are	going	to	go	for	a	little	ride	.
if	he	's	in	town	,	we	can	expect	news	for	the	weekend	edition	.
all	we	could	do	was	give	in	.	and	give	in	,	we	did	.
i	do	n't	lie	,	cheat	,	or	steal	for	anything	or	anyone	.
i	think	we	have	a	really	good	mix	of	brains	and	brawn	.
and	i	woke	,	sobbing	for	joy	,	because	you	were	here	.
i	saw	footage	of	that	on	the	news	last	night	.
i	'm	gon	na	try	and	reach	somebody	...	a	friend	on	the	phone	,
what	,	you	mean	that	gore	fest	in	the	store	window	?
hello	!	what	is	the	matter	?	yes	,	you	can	eat	it	!
oh	,	my	...	how	could	you	say	you	do	n't	remember	it	?
sitting	around	with	a	bunch	of	strangers	singing	"	kumbaya	"	is	n't	my	idea	of	self	-	help	.
where	are	we	going	?	-	grandma	is	gon	na	be	taking	you	.
i	was	stacking	them	one	on	top	of	the	other	,
i	would	n't	have	gone	all	this	way	to	help	you	.
i	do	n't	want	to	.	you	think	i	want	to	?	i	do	n't	!
so	you	can	pick	them	up	on	your	way	out	.
well	,	at	least	she	's	talking	to	us	.	i	guess	that	's	a	start	.
i	used	to	be	able	to	come	home	,	relax	,	get	something	to	eat	.
yes	,	but	it	does	n't	say	i	have	to	let	him	coach	out	the	rest	of	the	year	...
if	that	's	what	you	call	love	,	then	love	it	is
so	let	's	keep	our	eye	on	crude	oil	.	oh	,	that	's	too	bad	.
a	love	marriage	is	like	hot	soup	that	grows	cold	over	time	.
however	,	one	of	the	seven	would	betray	the	other	six	.
the	person	who	did	this	uses	fire	as	a	weapon	.
are	n't	you	tired	of	caring	for	this	place	-
i	do	not	wish	to	annoy	the	officer	,	but	i	have	a	request	to	make	.
you	should	sign	up	for	the	school	paper	.	we	're	the	voice	of	the	people	.
i	do	not	share	any	of	your	d.	n.	a.	,
i	know	,	but	i	'll	never	forget	that	i	owe	you	my	face	.
so	his	penis	was	extremely	sensitive	to	anything	touching	it	.
i	mean	,	we	'll	do	an	autopsy	,	try	to	figure	out	the	cause	,	but	...
i	'm	trying	to	loosen	the	knot	.	hold	tight	to	me	.
you	have	got	to	be	there	,	man	!	and	lots	of	dance	.
and	why	ca	n't	you	put	any	more	money	into	this	sure	thing	anyway	?
i	know	.	good	,	good	,	good	.	we	'll	see	you	.	bye	-	bye	.
look	,	i	know	you	guys	want	me	to	go	down	fighting	,	but	i	coward	.
and	i	told	you	i	do	n't	believe	in	that	big	of	a	coincidence	.
that	's	why	she	brought	me	along	,	but	honestly	i	'm	not	interested	,	no	offense	.
yeah	,	you	've	got	no	leverage	to	make	him	tell	you	anything	.	oh	,	shit	.
telling	me	how	handsome	my	son	is	?	well	,	that	i	am
seems	like	a	future	father	-	in	-	law	kind	of	thing	to	do	,	you	know	?
according	to	him	,	someone	hijacked	a	wmd	out	to	god	knows	where	.
i	talked	with	a	reporter	and	he	thought	i	was	crazy	.
you	ai	n't	gon	na	be	happy	until	somebody	comes	over	here
fifteen	years	at	the	bank	,	you	think	i	'm	involved	somehow	?
that	's	double	what	i	paid	for	this	whole	abbey	cloister	...	what	?	!
why	do	i	care	so	much	about	this	?	how	many	likes	i	get	on	a	stupid	website	?
you	come	back	,	you	whack	it	in	,	the	most	perfect	volley	in	the	world	,
what	would	you	want	the	other	person	to	say	,	like	,	right	before	?
well	,	how	do	you	know	i	'm	nice	?	maybe	i	'm	not	nice	.
i	was	born	in	1	88	,	wanna	see	my	i	d	?
exactly	where	is	it	i	'll	be	leading	'em	to	,	ma	'	am	?
from	now	on	i	forbid	you	to	take	care	about	me	.
i	think	it	's	worth	a	try	to	lure	him	over	here	.
if	i	'd	only	gone	out	to	play	with	him	like	i	said	i	would	,
do	n't	worry	.	the	navy	has	a	little	something	there	waiting	for	him	.
when	i	got	there	,	she	switched	the	channels	to	the	news	.
if	you	take	down	the	newspapers	,	you	do	n't	know	what	's	going	on	in	the	country	.
so	,	after	you	have	your	parents	fax	me	their	written	permission	indemnifying
we	kind	of	have	some	bigger	-	picture	concerns	right	now	.
i	do	n't	want	to	!	if	i	ca	n't	use	magic	,	what	have	i	got	?
for	richard	.	i	think	it	would	be	important	to	just	try	to	get	to	the	bottom	of	this	.
please	,	you	're	going	to	kill	us	all	.	-	stop	watching	us	!
let	's	go	off	the	bus	.	let	's	go	.	let	's	go	.	hurry	up	.
she	's	trying	to	buy	me	off	.	what	are	you	talking	about	?
from	what	i	hear	,	the	general	got	wiped	out	.	well	,	not	this	baby	.
that	dress	you	wore	last	month	in	the	shiny	sheet	?
i	ca	n't	do	this	anymore	.	you	can	and	you	will	.
and	i	'll	trade	you	the	names	of	the	other	six	people	i	killed
while	emptying	an	unknown	amount	from	the	bank	's	safe	deposit	box	.
so	,	what	price	are	you	demanding	for	leaving	this	residence	tonight	?
and	if	it	appears	that	bin	laden	is	not	there	you	can	sneak	away	and	they	are	the	brightest	.
by	pulling	a	map	of	the	world	down	in	front	of	the	blackboard	.
and	sometimes	you	just	have	to	rely	on	an	act	of	god	.
they	're	really	not	a	bad	bunch	when	you	get	to	know	them	.
hmm	.	i	did	my	exercises	and	went	for	a	run	.
because	she	admitted	killing	,	and	in	a	civilized	community	,	a	trial	's	inevitable	.
the	right	arm	of	france	had	been	amputated	in	the	settlement
last	time	i	checked	,	you	were	somewhere	in	-	between	.
oh	,	you	guys	should	have	broken	up	a	long	time	ago	.
why	waste	a	good	evening	that	could	be	much	better	spent	in	a	drunken	stupor	feeling	sorry	for	yourself	?
this	is	special	agent	donald	carruthers	of	the	fbi	hello	?	is	anyone	there	?	hello	?

so	i	'm	sure	you	wo	n't	mind	if	his	opinion	is	admitted	now	.
because	i	am	done	with	her	,	and	for	real	this	time	.
telling	me	how	much	she	wanted	to	come	and	stay	with	me	.

your	mother	thought	i	had	a	brief	encounter	with	a	local	peasant	girl	,
i	'd	never	have	made	the	leap	.	that	was	quite	something	.
turn	right	on	43rd	street	south	and	then	turn	right	on	4th	avenue	south	.
and	we	quite	often	have	to	bring	in	extra	crew	.
the	longer	i	stay	here	,	the	more	mers	lives	are	in	danger	.	come	on	.
it	's	about	these	two	parents	and	their	precious	boy	,	not	about	iraq	.
it	looks	horrible	to	pick	a	card	,	2	thirds	of	the	time
something	just	kept	knocking	them	down	,	so	we	stopped	hanging	them	up	.
i	'm	going	-	i	'm	describing	the	whole	molecule	to	you
ai	n't	that	what	you	keep	telling	me	?	"	get	in	line	,	effie	.	wait	your	turn	"
and	she	just	happened	to	be	a	leather	cuff	saleswoman	.

a	very	brave	man	in	tehran	will	almost	certainly	die	.
fire	's	not	a	good	idea	.	just	a	couple	of	minutes	.
been	around	long	enough	to	know	that	they	're	all	bad	days	,	at	least	for	somebody	.
i	know	i	'm	going	to	go	back	home	and	cry	,
yeah	,	i	do	n't	think	that	's	necessary	.	but	you	just	said	...
those	are	odds	i	do	n't	like	to	evaluate	in	front	of	a	weeping	mother	clutching	her	belly	.
but	if	it	's	at	the	cheetah	,	it	's	no	dancing	,	i	know	that
and	i	wondered	if	you	'd	have	any	interest	in	merging	some	of	our	resources	...
he	started	attacking	all	of	the	pets	at	the	clinic	.
i	ca	n't	do	it	when	the	other	guards	are	watching	.
you	do	n't	put	these	guys	down	,	that	stuffing	in	your	mattress	might	be	worth	a	whole	lot	less	.
what	can	i	do	,	howie	?	you	can	be	that	guy	.
we	got	bogeys	.	three	of	them	,	coming	right	at	me	.
gentlemen	,	if	this	had	been	an	actual	tennis	ball	machine	uprising	,
everybody	's	got	them	.	nobody	has	the	balls	to	use	them	.	right	?
you	really	are	psychic	,	cause	yeah	,	that	's	exactly	what	i	was	thinking	.
you	ever	given	any	thought	to	a	braille	watch	,	frank	?	-	randy	.
i	told	him	to	meet	us	at	the	bar	later	.
its	a	goddamn	shame	to	put	a	bullshit	like	that	on	a	classic	.
i	'm	sorry	.	there	's	nothing	else	i	can	do	but	take	a	message	.
cos	you	always	do	things	your	own	way	,	no	matter	what	other	people	think	.
sometimes	even	after	your	mind	knows	so	much	of	the	universe	...
so	on	june	15	,	2002	,	i	am	hereby	ordered	to	be	discharged	from	my	service	.
ten	years	you	two	have	been	working	on	this	plan	and	you	finally	pulled	it	off	.
the	only	time	i	get	to	act	like	your	mother
not	in	my	wildest	dreams	did	i	hope	to	find	the	lost	city	of	the	ancients	so	completely	untouched	,
okay	,	so	,	all	the	stammering	and	stuff	,	i	mean	,	that	's	not	...
it	snowballs	.	listen	,	can	i	get	a	little	bit	more	low	light	?
i	'm	a	big	old	asshole	who	beats	up	on	other	kids	...
i	have	n't	got	that	money	.	i	put	that	money	into	the	business	.
my	mind	works	like	that	.	i	'll	be	able	to	pull	something	off	a	lot	better	than	they	will	.
and	my	friend	's	little	brother	was	running	in	the	sand	-
if	they	do	n't	shape	up	,	if	we	lose	control	of	the	store	,	we	are	gon	na	have	a	pineapple	situation	.
did	you	know	that	the	life	cycle	of	a	truffle
they	kind	of	stare	back	at	me	when	i	'm	shaving	.
what	-	what	...	what	do	you	want	me	to	do	?
we	're	gon	na	be	listening	on	the	wire	the	whole	time	.
what	are	you	doing	up	here	lurking	on	your	balcony	?
did	you	say	something	about	us	to	her	or	not	?
well	,	i	'm	not	gon	na	let	you	win	,	either	,	white	boy	.
but	we	need	you	to	come	down	and	identify	him	in	a	lineup	.
my	money	first	,	then	you	can	hit	me	with	a	ball	.
and	i	'm	sorry	if	i	make	you	feel	like	i	do	n't	have	time	for	you	.
i	mean	,	he	know	we	were	gon	na	tear	the	place	apart	.
i	knew	she	needed	the	lamps	for	her	open	house	.
god	dammit	,	why	is	it	that	every	time	we	try	and	have	a	relaxing	day
i	was	waiting	for	you	to	get	out	of	court	.
and	you	also	wanna	buy	him	hundreds	of	dollars	worth	of	pants	.
what	i	will	do	now	is	go	into	your	office	and	become	naked	.
after	you	came	to	see	me	,	i	called	some	people	.
still	,	you	-	you	should	n't	have	to	keep	this	from	her	.
bad	call	?	these	people	are	dead	,	burke	!	have	you	any	idea	what	you	've	done	here	!
to	be	something	like	that	in	a	place	that	kills	thousands	of	chickens	every	day	.
i	do	n't	want	you	to	think	about	anything	except	if	it	looks	familiar	,	all	right	?
she	caused	me	to	fall	in	love	with	her	.	that	...
uh	...	we	were	just	.	uh	-	we	-	the	-
i	'm	going	to	tell	him	i	went	to	the	restaurant
the	only	thing	left	for	him	to	do	is	to	flunk	me
without	its	atmosphere	,	the	earth	would	not	be	a	home	to	us
kitchenettes	:	available	all	rooms	except	for	single	king	room	(	type	11	)	and	two	queen	beds	room	(	type	12	)
what	would	i	tell	them	if	they	saw	me	now	?
i	never	had	a	inkling	before	.	i	did	n't	know	what	to	do	with	it	.
the	panorama	rooms	are	designed	to	be	bright	and	friendly	,	offering	22	sq	.
this	dude	's	hole	and	crawl	around	for	a	few	days	.
this	is	fant	...	i	've	got	ta	have	a	go	at	this	.
well	,	it	was	great	in	its	time	,	but	the	time	's	up	.	life	moves	on	.
am	i	in	bed	?	if	i	'm	in	bed	,	i	'm	not	very	comfortable	.
you	wo	n't	even	think	about	her	patient	's	.	am	i	wrong	?
nancy	comes	home	and	there	's	bars	on	all	the	windows	.
i	once	went	to	give	him	the	updates	on	his	lost	son	.
you	want	me	to	run	,	so	you	can	put	a	bullet	in	my	back	.
whitney	,	when	i	told	him	how	i	felt	and	we	broke	up	.
i	ran	a	systems	check	on	her	work	,	and	it	turns	out	there	's	evidence	of	file	tampering	.
he	swore	a	solemn	oath	to	uphold	the	best	interests	of	the	lodge	.
ma	'	am	,	are	you	the	one	that	made	the	911	call	?
i	am	living	my	life	.	i	'd	like	to	continue	to	live	my	life	.
yeah	?	well	,	i	think	this	is	gon	na	better	all	right	?
i	'm	not	overcautious	,	but	anyway	,	i	want	to	ask	you
convenience	is	important	,	and	our	weatherford	hotel	is	close	to	shopping	and	dining	,	rodeos	,	golfing	,	sport	events	and	hunting	.
so	stop	worrying	about	whether	conservative	women	should	sleep	with	20	year	olds	...
it	is	so	great	that	even	though	you	and	i	have	a	past	,
i	know	drugs	are	good	and	bad	,	and	dangerous	and	fun	.
you	know	what	,	i	love	that	back	-	stage	stuff	.
so	do	n't	be	afraid	to	use	the	old	standbys	like	music	,
then	the	three	of	you	argued	over	what	to	do	next	.
let	's	hope	word	of	the	evac	order	made	it	out	this	far	.

if	i	just	could	have	made	a	little	more	money	from	those	lawsuits	,
i	'd	begun	to	think	you	got	called	up	in	the	rapture	or	something	.
he	's	not	going	to	be	happy	with	that	,	landing	in	beirut	.
because	that	's	what	squirts	do	!	now	,	shut	your	pie	hole	!
when	i	was	ten	years	old	i	stood	up	in	court	and	i	testified

oh	,	come	on	,	babe	.	i	want	to	do	it	with	the	mask	on	.
if	we	get	in	trouble	,	you	're	going	to	be	there	,	right	?
why	?	'cause	he	was	good	at	it	,	and	it	made	him	rich	.

and	one	of	them	is	this	nifty	little	tracking	node	surgically	implanted	in	your	body	,
and	when	i	come	back	,	it	'll	be	with	a	warrant	.
i	'm	worried	she	's	going	to	kill	him	,	and	then	we	'll	have	no	leads	.
the	other	guy	said	it	's	down	here	to	the	right	.	so	i	have	no	idea	.
now	mara	,	on	the	other	hand	...	she	grows	on	you	.

but	i	stood	out	like	a	sore	thumb	at	these	provincial	schools	.
her	mom	's	out	of	town	,	and	her	brother	's	not	answering	.
ok	,	and	do	n't	say	it	's	a	disease	because	that	just	would	qualify	as	bullshit	right	now	.
he	's	too	stiff	here	and	he	was	too	animated	tonight	.
we	were	doomed	the	moment	we	had	to	leave	our	homes	.
we	're	losing	by	only	three	points	.	we	can	win	this	game	.
but	i	'm	obligated	to	offer	you	protection	from	a	fugitive	who	i	think	is	coming	after	you	.

hotels	in	pierre	,	sd	offer	some	of	the	best	customer	service	available	.
give	me	a	doctor	with	a	steady	hand	over	one	with	a	steady	home	anytime	.
but	i	just	think	that	it	was	a	little	bit	too	down	-	home	...
because	i	was	n't	able	to	help	them	when	they	needed	me	most	.
it	's	all	so	safe	.	i	crave	danger	.	you	would	n't	understand	.
i	got	the	pictures	you	asked	me	to	get	.	-	you	can	just	put	them	right	there	.
still	,	it	just	came	earlier	than	i	thought	it	would	.
but	when	you	get	a	chance	to	get	in	on	something	like	that	...
without	a	map	to	follow	that	reasoning	,	i	say	,	take	a	hat	,	it	's	cold	outside	.
it	's	nice	to	see	you	in	the	real	world	,	away	from	shreck	.
i	feel	like	this	is	one	more	dream	i	'm	just	going	through	.
and	who	authorized	you	to	tell	me	this	?	that	's	all	i	'm	authorized	to	say	.
our	job	is	to	break	that	pattern	by	letting	her	know	that

sorry	i	was	such	a	bastard	when	i	went	to	your	place	.
acting	like	a	tough	guy	in	front	of	your	new	girlfriend	here	.
showers	are	here	.	water	's	not	too	hot	,	but	it	runs	.
if	this	guy	caused	the	blackout	,	what	's	that	mean	for	mosaic	?
to	understand	is	the	impressions	i	get	,	the	things	that	i	see	,
she	believes	they	were	flying	formation	,	and	then	suddenly	died	at	approximately	the	same	time	.
and	i	would	be	lucky	to	have	you	before	the	debut	of	your	new	line	,
i	tell	you	what	,	if	our	school	was	this	nice	,
i	can	do	it	on	the	engine	cos	the	engine	's	quiet	.
so	i	want	someone	to	go	to	the	mainland	tomorrow	morning	.
i	'm	not	gon	na	wag	my	finger	if	that	's	what	you	expect	.
i	determined	to	save	up	so	that	chambermaid	would	be	mine	.

hey	,	anthony	,	listen	,	i	'll	catch	one	for	you	in	secret	.
and	you	're	such	a	cowboy	,	you	'd	never	admit	it	,	so	i	'm	taking	the	initiative	,

i	'm	trying	to	talk	to	you	about	what	's	going	on	.
s	let	's	change	the	subject	,	get	you	out	of	this	one	.
but	if	i	eat	this	thing	,	i	ca	n't	act	not	dead	.
but	what	happens	is	they	tie	their	eggs	onto	the	sea	whips
it	's	turned	into	a	truly	desperate	struggle	against	the	clock	.

you	have	n't	seen	her	yet	,	right	?	it	might	not	be	her	,	right	?
so	...	you	and	i	...	are	gon	na	take	that	elevator	...	right	now	,	together	.
do	n't	you	need	a	warrant	to	go	poking	around	like	this	?
you	used	to	be	five	-	three	.	after	your	injury	,
we	saw	a	different	side	of	you	your	vocals	were	spot	-	on	.
would	i	leave	you	the	combination	if	i	was	trying	to	get	you	killed	?
which	i	usually	do	n't	do	,	i	do	n't	know	why	but	i	did	,	and	this	time	i	looked	over	...
and	,	yeah	,	it	has	been	tough	.	well	,	that	's	not	good	enough	anymore	.
how	long	will	you	let	the	gentiles	continue	to	drive	us	away	?
i	have	an	enormous	respect	for	nurses	,	but	most	of	them	scare	me	.
if	they	play	badly	,	maybe	it	's	a	good	time	to	make	a	change	.
if	he	thinks	he	is	or	even	if	he	's	confused	-	on	that	issue	,	he	will	kill	again	.
well	,	you	find	the	liturgy	in	the	east	to	be	so	much	richer	in	symbolism	.
by	the	way	,	counsel	.	do	you	really	think	i	'm	innocent	?
hey	,	look	,	i	know	i	'm	new	and	green	and	a	joke	to	you	,

i	mean	,	besides	losing	you	,	your	father	will	lose	his	career	.
we	can	do	a	full	autopsy	.	there	's	just	one	problem	.
i	could	let	him	smoke	cigarettes	all	day	on	the	dock	...
he	's	been	using	me	for	comic	fodder	since	my	arrest	.
sorry	about	that	.	i	had	to	take	a	call	.	work	.
what	i	know	about	the	world	,	it	changes	every	day	.
i	offered	it	to	dumbledore	as	headquarters	for	the	order	.

oh	,	yeah	?	-	yeah	,	you	're	away	at	your	job	all	day	.
i	think	,	if	he	were	hurting	,	he	would	n't	let	anyone	know	.
the	sooner	you	...	the	sooner	you	rule	me	out	,	the	sooner
pulling	out	walls	is	much	better	than	banging	my	head	against	the	one	that	is	my	husband	.
but	,	jas	,	you	said	boys	do	n't	rate	girls	for	funniness	.
he	's	throwing	away	his	presidency	like	...	like	it	was	nothing	.

great	.	okay	,	first	of	all	,	what	can	i	tell	you	?
father	,	i	come	before	you	in	prayer	and	in	faith	believing	.

captain	mallory	,	my	congratulations	.	you	have	made	a	remarkable	effort	.
but	she	's	all	you	.	chip	off	the	old	perfect	block	.
even	though	i	love	having	sex	with	some	hot	,	random	trim	...
good	,	because	i	think	i	have	someone	you	just	might	be	interested	in	.
if	mommy	and	daddy	are	gon	na	screw	that	up	,	then	-
but	as	you	can	see	,	he	does	n't	go	anywhere	near	her	for	counsel	.
i	found	this	$	20	on	the	way	to	school	today	.
oh	,	he	's	fine	.	but	his	family	was	found	murdered	this	morning	.

thousands	of	years	ago	,	these	hunters	found	a	backwater	planet	.
yeah	,	but	is	n't	it	bad	luck	to	buy	a	dress	for	the	victory	party	before	the	election	?
if	i	do	n't	,	neither	of	us	will	ever	speak	again
what	do	you	mean	they	do	n't	know	what	wrong	with	it	?
oh	,	good	,	'cause	now	all	we	need	is	a	tow	or	a	phone	to	call	one	with	.
made	it	hard	to	convince	the	judge	there	was	a	risk	of	flight	.
for	this	round	,	you	must	bounce	the	ball	on	the	drum	,	over	a	series	of	obstacles	.
you	are	going	to	charge	me	and	i	am	going	to	pay	you	,
i	did	n't	want	to	have	to	tell	u	this	,	but	i	'm	spying	again	,
if	you	get	bored	tomorrow	,	give	me	a	call	.	we	can	play	.
you	know	,	if	you	watched	the	local	news	like	a	normal	person	,
you	do	what	you	want	,	but	i	'm	in	.	i	'm	staying	.
i	mean	,	come	on	,	baby	.	we	are	living	the	dream	.

let	's	assume	that	these	same	guys	commit	other	types	of	crimes	.
how	was	that	for	you	two	?	man	,	you	touched	me	.
i	can	dislike	more	than	one	person	at	a	time	.
that	agents	are	uc	dressed	as	a	squint	and	wonder	woman	.
guests	can	enjoy	a	complimentary	full	breakfast	buffet	with	organic	bread	and	free	wi	-	fi	all	over	the	hotel	.
so	i	'm	gon	na	have	to	pursue	it	on	my	own	.
i	have	mixed	feelings	about	that	.	i	do	n't	blame	you	.
and	it	did	n't	take	me	long	to	work	out	who	the	first	person	was	.
these	two	kids	,	all	they	care	about	is	their	girl	.
so	,	i	'll	be	able	to	play	with	them	.	i	do	n't	see	why	not	.
you	know	,	why	am	i	even	trying	to	prove	myself	to	you	?
you	need	someone	who	's	gon	na	force	you	to	loosen	up	.
i	knew	i	had	to	get	that	book	as	far	away	from	me	as	i	possibly	could	.
you	were	spreading	shit	about	my	brother	behind	my	back	.
you	got	ta	keep	him	on	the	line	long	enough	to	get	a	location	.
the	kids	really	need	to	go	to	school	,	not	to	mention	...
one	dinner	each	night	for	two	adults	and	two	children	.
thank	you	for	that	.	congratulations	on	the	enormity	of	your	success	.
we	've	all	tried	to	be	there	for	you	and	brenda	,	during	this	tough	time	.
a	man	would	wear	a	shirt	like	this	in	public	.

and	i	saw	the	great	lakes	from	the	rail	of	a	missile	frigate
but	i	know	he	was	a	kind	man	,	a	gentle	man	,
i	just	cut	short	a	call	with	the	secretary	of	state	.	i	hope	this	is	worth	it	.
well	,	as	we	fall	in	love	,	we	know	,	we	've	recorded
i	'll	give	you	a	hundred	dollars	if	you	'll	do	it	.

jack	told	us	that	audrey	's	meeting	paul	in	his	room	.	jack	's	on	his	way	over	.
if	you	do	n't	mind	...	why	did	you	wanted	to	desert	?
of	course	,	if	i	could	be	born	again	,	i	'd	have	a	word	with	god	.
but	i	'm	sure	two	women	of	reason	can	find	a	compromise	.
get	hold	of	his	bridle	and	lead	him	to	me	.
welcome	gift	includes	a	box	of	chocolates	and/or	flowers	in	your	room	upon	arrival	.

can	i	get	some	soup	,	please	?	20	francs	.	you	new	?
and	if	you	wo	n't	put	yourself	out	of	your	misery	,
i	'm	a	worm	in	her	sight	.	you	are	not	a	worm	.
why	not	kill	me	,	too	?	i	mean	,	he	leaves	me	behind	?

whether	you	're	in	town	for	business	or	pleasure	,	you	deserve	a	great	location	and	plenty	of	free	amenities	.
dirk	and	company	went	over	faster	than	a	one	-	legged	cat	in	a	sand	box	.
if	you	oversleep	,	a	hand	comes	out	and	slaps	you	in	the	face	.

dude	.	i	ca	n't	believe	you	'd	pass	by	a	gig	opportunity	...
i	stole	his	keys	.	we	'll	take	it	to	a	car	wash	.
she	could	be	heading	up	a	river	into	the	heart	of	darkness	.
when	i	came	face	-	to	-	face	with	something	that	only	could	have	been	the	legendary	yeti	.
i	'll	talk	to	local	up	there	,	see	what	they	know	.
my	mom	probably	wants	it	,	i	'm	sure	my	little	sister	.
you	have	to	remember	to	let	me	call	my	father	when	we	land	.
if	my	old	man	can	do	it	,	who	the	hell	says	i	ca	n't	?

every	year	,	they	proliferate	into	huge	brumes	that	color	the	ocean	green	.
i	,	uh	,	thought	you	were	a	coyote	rummaging	around	in	the	trash	.
but	daddy	's	company	did	n't	come	up	with	that	one	.	dupont	did	.
yeah	,	and	they	said	the	weather	's	gon	na	be	nice	like	this	all	day	!
but	as	long	as	i	am	the	captain	.	nobody	can	play	.
if	the	board	knew	i	was	here	,	i	'd	probably	be	fired	.
you	want	to	do	one	after	lunch	?	i	've	got	another	coli	.
and	the	only	people	who	ask	us	for	money	are	bums
i	'd	rather	see	her	at	the	bottom	of	the	ocean

and	in	her	own	way	,	she	's	just	trying	to	look	out	for	me	.
i	understand	that	you	've	had	a	rough	time	of	it	out	there	...
what	would	someone	have	to	gain	from	attacking	that	meeting	?
what	do	you	think	?	shall	we	keep	these	walls	brick	or	make	it	stucco	?
the	big	man	.	here	,	take	this	out	of	here	.	what	he	doing	here	?
jesus	.	what	the	hell	were	you	guys	doing	over	there	?
lycan	youth	rallied	in	the	same	way	against	the	prudence	of	their	elders	.
if	i	tell	you	a	secret	,	do	you	promise	not	to	tell	anybody	?
you	two	ca	n't	be	in	love	,	she	's	just	too	important	to	this	town	.
it	is	as	much	a	mystery	now	as	when	the	trial	began	.
i	swear	on	the	body	and	soul	of	my	mother	.
you	guys	got	ta	tuck	your	shirts	in	all	the	way	.
all	right	,	you	guys	stay	here	and	take	care	of	the	dragons	.
but	i	already	told	you	i	'm	not	going	to	do	that	.
if	i	ever	screw	up	again	,	you	give	that	to	my	parents	.
so	i	'll	have	five	chatty	children	,	a	chatty	husband	and	live	in	a	house	in	the	wilderness	.
how	hard	is	it	to	get	a	couple	drinks	right	,	huh	?
